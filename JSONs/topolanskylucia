leave a younger caucus the 609 propose that sworn statements from all legislators are public transparent truths in a huge effort to get a balanced budget which is the fundamental law of the 1st year at the interview to the senator in interview to the senator in con is currently chairing the session in the chamber of in the chamber of on the environment and the on in  we share an interview with on el it is interesting what happens in the fa there are new people in the 711 in the socialist party and in other sectors the candidate does not have to be yes or yes of the beyond that i have my chips there we have supported figures from other sectors the has very interesting figures but not only the the has them facing 2019 in will turn 81 years and they ask him to be a candidate but we will work to generate spare parts the spare parts are good said we understand gas and point and this is not the case public companies are the engine of our economy theme i think as is not cast you can not say that like that and you have to let the researcher work in the  period intentionally we play the growth of public companies and grew there are no essential men there are essential causes and the key to is the unity to fight for those causes the achieved diversity and is what the left of other countries admire the fa there are different personalities and freedom to be the theme of was difficult to swallow but it came out i congratulate you have gone back is not the country of 2005 nor the is the one from 2005 we have walked and learned a lot in the relationship between and is good they do not have to be kissing to show their relationship in we have to go to with countries that need our production not with our competitors in we come through the  three governments of the opening markets and we have a positive balance although there is still in the budgets the always can and must adjust the budget terms whatever the government is i wish would do well if is doing well is doing well if it is going badly is doing badly i am not against private management but the driving of a country is not the management of a company lo striking of is that he made a council of that although it is qualified it is innate of the in the vulture funds cornered those who said that in there were no guarantees they must say i was wrong because it is a system with guarantees in hopefully it goes very well to  and if we do not respect we will not be respected i believe in the sovereignty of the people and we must respect the results whether they like it or not both processes were transparent in an interview the senator in approved the a difficult task because 100 of the demands are fair and real experience of is gathered in generation of housing and neighborhood urbanization and housing are things that go hand in hand many people through money materials or volunteering collaborated with now transferred to the budget the of the absolutely balanced has tools to fulfill the proposed tasks of settlements  supposes integration of the urban plot deals budget of the this period we project construction of 20500 new homes 15000 loans for renovation and 6000 rental guarantees we have the difficult task of building the in which we strive in order to achieve the greatest equilibrium he and the will participate in the participated in a round table on the of in violence against women today 800 pm will be exhibiting at i followed the intervention live from of against  i do not think that the has substantial changes in senators in negotiations they can have they have not been proven unlawful and the investigators are for that in the researcher has been working well and there are still no conclusions the document had a general economic analysis the idea is to exchange politically with it was decided to make a budget to two years almost all countries in the world do so this gives us some mobility in needed more budget to ensure more quotas which will generate more teachers on budget the only possibility was redistribution of items we were worried that had no budget  hello we ask if you can contact today from 10 interview in the program tomorrow in of in the things that concern me most for this period is to take a leap in education and maintain public investment in at this moment we do not have in the fa a unanimous personality like thats why i prefer a collective in the law of is going to be a very important support for families grows with you and are essential in over budget we want to strengthen the support network for addicts which currently serves about 1800 in where those monies could go we prioritized the creation of multidisciplinary teams in education  on about budget the comrades did an ant job they looked for monies that could be postponed from 13 interview to the senator from in explained debate in the on and remembered that in there was no irregularities or crime in investigative envelope what  it is clear that no crime is mentioned in we believe in having strong and as an engine of the economy others believe that not in the tax reform was the most profound reform of the state but reform is not once and for all in contribution in is 19 private education is exempt go if it will be subsidized in the tax matter is not static it is no sin to say it think it or study it in get to as we did last period we proposed a 45 and reach a 47 i believe in the democracy of parties parties are voted with programs that is why it is important to discuss and help the in with what more coincidental of the budget that  was a success of the economic team is that it is years in we work we think things we are convinced that you can contribute in a meeting with we wanted to help or to impose or to say we own the truth in we asked the president for a meeting we had a document to present him that still could not be given in only us we are not a majority we are something because we are part of in we conceive the government as a team with the
