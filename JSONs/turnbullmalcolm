the rim rim replaced by gain now irrelevant you have  fast suggest you check the site and you will see is continuing once is pulled to the pillar and the installed the port issue is gone all the side lines are is it possible to have a rational discussion on twitter the and the outrage mp actually they were not ignored places like while overbuilt areas no based on need we have to do both because our job is made so much harder by the mess they left us labors plan penalized areas by not prioritizing them and making them wait longer and pay more so whose plan is fairer 22 two facts our approach to will address areas sooner and the service will be more affordable 12 well i have been minister for six months had six years  and did nothing we are the first ever to actually ascertain the relative quality of across simply care about divides fact is that precincts like will get upgraded much sooner under our plan areas are priority when did journalists stop reporting what people say and instead put ludicrous words in their mouths instead full of ideas about how to run or time to step up applications for now open i am not saying it should or be just asking whether and to what extent it is apparently this is a taboo well of course not thats why we are prioritizing under served areas driving back from enjoying for another great album with today sure yr medical alarms are registered  1800227300 with mayor and chief officer launching the medical alarms register try telling someone with no at all that it matter how long it takes to get them so its shameful to tell the truth is it or is it that you are ashamed of the mess left us to clean up we will get to everyone with either fixed line wireless or satellite to 93 yes and it have taken more years over 30 more cost and raise prices by up to 80 and you care how long it takes or costs fine if you are rich have good now but if not not so much truth hurts it labors bungling has wasted billions and caused many without to go without for years apart from fact it costs much  more takes much longer and is therefore less affordable so what about effort in regions satellite service work wireless solution which lacks sufficient spectrum on the other hand assess relative quality and rolled out in some areas already had good key difference our approach to and is that we will the least well served areas no or poor this is what i said last night about promised wireless broadband without having the spectrum to deliver it okay how far are you from the pillar in the street but also interesting to know why someone to whom is so vital buy a new house where she says there is none of course its my job to complete the and i will do so sooner cheaper and  more than ever do no just asking you a simple question which you refuse to answer no i am simply asking whether given the importance of to you you checked availability before buying yr new house why then did none of the other 100 present spin the speech in the same misleading way you did the quotes look right to me and of course do not remotely support the headline the quotes look okay get hold of a video from and post it very poor journalism from the headline
