the weekend with did you foresee that why can not i find the article yes the first project was completely useless nothing to find in only wardrobe free strategy yes that is the reason but itself decides how and if they want to text i look see like viewing searching in vain for for articles in spring 2015 where you anticipated interesting but here in the country we have the free press the speech has been entered and now in their hands certainly did not stop the idea of pension reform we do not take belongings ask them to pay for food and lodging if they can these are the fewest also applies to assistance clients  has seen read and listened but its now a bit black and white hope you get some shades on before triple yep he is a good boy why do you ask i am sorry to hear why everything else would also have been embarrassing thanks to old years now singing on last verse nice to find that there are actually votes in the public debate that has the sources in order  of course i write myself otherwise there would not be so many errands much thanks and happy for the last minute about the personal  responsibility year who is talking about opting out i do not to change the same discussion takes place in virtually all countries thoughts for emergency workers who bump into water and everyone else who works for our sake here on days does not talk to abolish but about the need for adaptation to a new and more world agree but the age has slowed and let the kids do it therefore we have no hat for the last many years thanks and in the same way  is wanted here from door in calendar opened thanks to those who came with not fine without and merry  welcome to and merry then its the day before the day the penultimate door is opened calendar i can not imagine they are doing

thanks to the womens team for sublime entertainment as i said in disguise see you in for the my colleague and all congratulations  with the world cup in you should be wiser the story is the purest spell thought you were busy putting tabloid down these days summit ends time to the day  calendar calendar good meeting with chairman but it is also clear that the parallel agreement on becomes very difficult 17 about draft beer with direct inspiration from cozy interview with journalist yesterday  and i totally agree it is unimaginable the history of is not exactly the political debate practice but how was it nice nice fighting and unity inspire all of us 15th todays door is about a swimming pool that did not happen calendar agreement in house in and the have worked hard to achieve this a crucial turning point in global climate action then half past the calendar layer 12 is just laid up calendar the next step is a meeting with all the parliamentary parties one week next week then there is a calendar again today there  calendar writing in gate in my calendar calendar then gate number in my calendar is opened thoughts on the first day of school calendar then gate number has been opened in my calendar calendar almost 300 questions in an hour to answer a part but now i have to perform my civil obligation vote the selection is in progress answering question questions on now vote we can not get a little respect for political agreements will not happen without referendum elections continued support for the reform process in and sanctions to ensure the agreement no the billions will not come if the effect is left out business  the roof is on our side visiting the in a little while many reasons for a vote thanks for reelection as its a huge privilege make me grateful and humble the secretary of the honors my political girlfriend at with good reason thank you  law agreement in place job good with broad support for yes the 312 pol does not scold just does not reach an exceptional situation but continued opportunity for judicial review so good feature on skewed representation of the proposal state and government leaders call for a minutes silence at 12 in memory of the victims of everyone will follow it the result can only be done on the one who laughs last laughs best  i am terrified by the attacks in thoughts go to all in the evening here an independent point that the vast majority of parties support a yes answer yourself welcome good  lovely with direct contact between and thus the world is both big and small same to you you too depends on circumstances listening to the debate here  while writing it may well hang together more efficient for quick dissemination of short news info to journalists disadvantage make sure that the response is representative say the most clarified that responds it will probably come after the end of the meeting and seen by more 184000 on 49000 here because it is the entrance ticket has increased the amount in the light of the negotiations always self can be seen on spelling and typing errors  appears directly by post if it is rarely my staff really trust more thorough longer more shades when farther out due to longer posts more shades 22 if you only follow friends and express themselves in a square conversely great opportunity for close also with 12 as a starting point positive influence if we politicians take it seriously but also the risk of polarization varies a lot on right now when i listen to a speech from delegate from has just announced that contributes million  to the founded today in i prioritize it quite high more prosperity in fund fewer increases to the resettlement something for something  basis for concrete negotiations it will be difficult i hope we will succeed because

receiving your call in 40 minutes  will believe that the independent media publishes the figures neutrally and objectively we will see but it will not be with the new governments eyes it will be with the of have seen your comment about the governments new communications device i am now writing all my updates etc self  for me its actually an ambition to hold electoral promises maybe its an innovation but really its an old virtue it will be a small government so its called  thanks for the cup fresh on a new one do you have a specific area in the binoculars thank you everyone knows that i love journalists so that was the least i could do farms  is the family far away perhaps you can do it all requires overview and multitasking thank you yep remember to keep some free time it was fun at least  be included of course employees can bring more dishes to the table channels is in a brilliant mood trust my own policy so do not speak in every sentence to distort others it was  no criticism

at your workplace goes  for elections on additional costs for asylum in 2016 gone my nose past but either journalist there are three options tax increases 2nd lifting breach in other areas deficit unclear which model prefers are electric cars electricity reform and asylum costs which probably slash 15 billion of next years room for two billion a part of the campaign of the 39 billion the wise

much more to come after he is worried about whether i get my beauty sleep but now the hardest worker  being interesting to hear i also update myself on everything forgiven good that the minister of was not in the parliament today would  put the export back a bit why do you think so that you have decoded that we in the left have the confidence let it finally pervade your analyzes  should i write if we call in the left we hold our promises but of course we will win first pure logic to close to the choice so close to cases perhaps it ends with a broad majority behind after the election has left

pattern from the end where everything could be arranged in 12 minutes still a little funny that the government always talks about me and when they ask themselves example in finance thanks for a nice talk especially in the music breaks so much fun is not it at international conferences  thanks the police must effectively fight crime gt yes to believe on a referendum vote we do not stop by 25 and

example be that better security of institutions is more important than a ministerial congress whose things were seen in context no need to ask for overall basis for total pol discussion on the contrary it ensures overbidding easy solutions the terrorist threat requires a comprehensive thoughtful response this requires a comprehensive overview therefore need a written statement for using social media is about true presence and show that you master honest  with your followers congratulations on and the something of a business to become eligible then you are also ready for the election

attack naively my friend quiet i understand you have taken the hammock i have never tried such a thing to ask the police yourself they are deliberately unhappy with equipment and training polemical and funny  exciting life you have breaking no peace of mind by following up on your own proposal from about a police service check is soon ready of course we do not but we must continue to think about how to create max security after terror in i proposed to provide police pet service checks reg well soon ready in and share bids its impossible to sleep now a nightmare has hit this night i put my trust in the selfless and talented people in the police and at respect its kl like that they invited must be there to back up on par incredibly fun  others pay people have earned the money they are paying for themselves if not if the promise had been held then it would have been a nice campaign will reintroduce the from 1115 otherwise all who hope and believe in a new government will first order craftsmen after the election is it populism to implement its policy suppose that is not populist hope to meet many with different political and religious views in front of the at 2145 takes at the at 2145 to show sympathy hope to see many with different religious views with entry into force after the parliamentary elections so the voters could decide on it and us before its fair the difference  is
