that we should pay attention to the interest of the and the will of the people and society and decided in favor of the and the society it should pave the way for exports and the provinces and the free zones can be activated this year government revenues are far from budgeted in these circumstances we need to create a boom using the potential of the nongovernmental sector feast with governors and deputy ministers we hope we can create conditions that will reduce the pressure on the people meet  with the of the should enjoy its full rights like the other member countries of the safeguards the government will never make revenues on the import route to spend 720 billion on imports during the next eight years but the issues of employment environment and water will not be resolved if negotiations succeed meaning not abandoning the resistance economy nor the return and reproduction of previous years of implementation the government is well prepared to break the path if they break the agreement every day  to turn back and change more than they are in their minds if we are committed to fulfilling their obligations under the agreement we will remain committed in the agreement the two sides showed that they were doing what they were committing we agreed to 100 and the other side was partly fulfilling its obligations if the other party claims that he wants to prevent the construction of a nuclear weapon although does not seek it from the beginning this goal will be achieved for them by the endowment of the with the media and the media  the talks could have a outcome for both sides the government is prepared to work with the judiciary to formulate a political crime bill and to clarify what political crime is what is security crime our judicial system must be transparent to everyone this transparency is not just law our judicial procedures must be transparent and open to the public the judiciary between and a judiciary between the and the the judicial system between the faction and that faction and that party and that party is the smallest difference  not to be the world looks to the of as an example of and speculation and has very high expectations convocation of the in terms of management and planning in terms of the size of the oppression of a personality the martyr was inadequate the construction of the parties in political activities should not be to win one another or to eliminate one since the avoidance of monopoly is in the interest of society an feast with a group of reformist and principled political activists  yesterdays meeting with the leader our national success in negotiations will be for the nation and the supreme leader of the revolution in 1993 with a drop in inflation and an economic growth of the governments promise to curb inflation as well as exit from the recession and negative economic growth were realized we hope that the minister of impeachment session will be held in the best sense of sympathy and cooperation between the government and the parliament government meeting and negotiations  within the framework of the guidelines of the leader the and the constitution we want the peoples happiness we want employment and economic prosperity and social welfare and do not give centrifuges to this government in but rather where imposed sanctions will be imposed and we will abolish sanctions there every commodity that comes from abroad is at least 10 to 15 percent more expensive and this is the cruelty of malice  imposed sanctions on the chain from the beginning of the year to the present day the government has imported less food from abroad since the beginning of the year this means the government moves on the path to increasing domestic production we fight boycotts those who say that sanctions do not matter from peoples pockets i do not care about i hope if this agreement is signed all countries are obliged to implement it the good work of this agreement will revive the opposition gasoline two rates of  thats why we made it there are about 10 trillion of deficit in subsidy payments per year the has not banned anyone and any material is false the capital market should look for longterm rather than the basis of capital markets depends on economic prosperity the government does not directly interfere with the market but it monitors that it is transparent and not bubble and we support the will be implemented by 124 countries without any special issue  definitely will not allow its military secrets to be handed over to others through sanctions and has failed to achieve its goals but has been effective and causing problems no country has been closed behind closed doors since its inception it has been pushing for its economic plans economic growth has hit a negative to a positive level this boycott was also for the purchase of wheat and for any investment in these sanctions were even for the construction of a barrier  provided water to a city the government has been struggling to steer sanctions but these outrageous illegal and inhumane sanctions have been blamed and not smart 24 is not owned by any party or group but belongs to the nation presidential election will be broadcast on 16th of todays news network tonight the hall the beginning of the people did not know the meaning of the boycott at the outset of course should not be against  lets surrender to the wrong people but we must move on to the fore and step forward the restoration of will not be realized within a short time and the process of compensating for the destruction of 10 years will be at least 15 years today gasoline produced in petrochemical complexes is set aside and gasoline is supplied in metropolises which has had an impact on reducing air pollution the commemoration ceremony of the week is around if we do not keep up with each other the government will not succeed in preserving and restoring the environment  we will continue our journey and break the sanctions on grace and will overcome the problems with national unity and solidarity the ceremony of the anniversary of death if the did not say that the nations vote is the enemies would take revolution from us in the elections held in the president will act as constitutional authority for both the and the of course the government must abandon itself from the political rivalry  this does not mean that or they come in the election the government does not enter into such a stream in any way in the sense that it is supposed to be a supporter of this or that aggregate no factions in the country can be eliminated neither this side nor those of sleep these factions have intellectual historical ideological religious and scientific roots i do not know where the guy came from they do not ever want to be sweet people people are afraid of smile i do not know what that series is has the right  in a frivolous tone to the of the front of the diplomatic front has the right where did this note come from one of the reasons for the stability today is that people are convinced that there are experts experts and devotees in the government and the executive body and decide in the 92nd election between the first and second people there were 13 million dissent votes meaning that conscious and accountable people chose a route and chose that today people are not crazy about storing the gender in their house  it means that the way of government has been right today some people freely and easily criticize the government without stuttering means the correct way for the government we will make our paths strong with the support of the people and the guidance of the leader like in the past months in spite of the very small minority that gained large speakers

looking for a wall in the classroom that  these are the ridiculing of is there a way to promote chastity in the community van we have no other way our ladies who are and academically do not have a way to spread chastity and this government is afraid of the threat whatever it takes to fight corruption and to develop the country we know rents not only in the economic spheres but when one wants to
