Allegations in the #CharlesTaylor case go back to 1996,& today's judgment proves that although justice has been delayed it cannot be denied These acts are not only crimes against the victims, but crimes against humanity. The #CharlesTaylor case signals to the women, children and communities affected by #sexualviolence that the world is watching. I have heard firsthand the stories of these survivors when I visited Sierra Leone last year. The #CharlesTaylor trial may appear to concern just one perpetrator, but it gives voice to all survivors. When I took up office as UN Special Representative on #sexualviolence in Conflict two years ago, I made addressing impunity my top priority The successful prosecution of a former President signals that no leader‚Äìhowever powerful‚Äìis above the law;&that no woman or girl is below it Judgment of #CharlesTaylor: Today represents a milestone in the history of international criminal justice The Taylor judgment is about to be pronounced http://t.co/5aFGWqeW In Leidschendam (in the Hague), awaiting the judgment of #CharlesTaylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. #sexualviolence isn't limited to any culture/ context.It happens in conflict,post-conflict situations&in the context of pol.strife Conflict-related #sexualviolence affects not only the individual but the whole construction of society, tearing entire societies apart. Using #sexualviolence against women means targeting the backbone of society as women often bear the primary responsibility for the family. The myth that #sexualviolence would be a lesser crime is not shared by survivors: "They have taken my life without killing me." The shame and the stigma surrounding the issue of #sexualviolence must end and perpetrators be held accountable for their misdeeds. In the words of one Libyan survivor of #sexualviolence: "If the bleeding had stopped, I would never have reported it." Very often, the blame falls on the survivors of #sexualviolence. They have to bear the shame while the perpetrators go free. Conflict-related #sexualviolence is surrounded by several myths and misconceptions: That it'd be inevitable, unspeakable and a lesser crime.

The world is watching. While #sexualviolence disproportionately affects women and girls, men and boys also number among the direct and indirect victims. I'm particlrly concerned that unless women can shape their own polit'cl&pers'nl destiny,the #arabspring will turn in2 a winter 4 #Arab women Women have fought daily wars - not for medals&monuments - but battles for bread,battles to feed their children,& to make their presence felt We must send a message that women‚Äôs lives and votes and voices count, and will be counted. Rape has a chilling effect on women‚Äôs pol prtciption,casting a long shadow of trauma,inhibiting their access 2 polling booths&public squares The aim is not only to protect women from #sexualviolence; it is to protect them to participate in public and economic life. The #UN #securitycouncil has understood that there can be no security without women‚Äôs security. We also know that #militarized #mining can fuel #humanrights violations by enriching armed groups, for instance in the #DRC In #Somalia,a practice has recently been detected of nat'l sec forces renting out their uniforms 2 civilians by night,which facilitates rape #sexualviolence is often perpetuated by incomplete disarmament and the absence of vetting, training and security sector reform. The proliferation of #smallarmsandlightweapons enable these atrocities. As many women have told me: ‚ÄúThat man had the gun,&he had the power‚Äù #conflictrelatedsexualviolence is not a ‚Äúfact of human history‚Äù, like disease or drought; it is often planned and therefore predictable. Improved data-collection is therefore inextricably linked w/ improved assistance.Our primary focus must always be needs, rather than numbers Due to the blame, shame and stigma, most survivors still have more to lose than to gain from reporting rape. The relationship betw incidents&reports of #wartimerape is like the relatshp between the tip&the mass of an iceberg=only extremity's visible This underscores that we cannot wait for hard data on #sexualviolence to surface before taking action Yet survivors r only coming forward in cases of urgt medic need.A Libyan victim:‚ÄúIf the bleeding had stopped,I would never have reported it‚Äù In #Libya,UN info indicates a pattern of women being abducted from their homes,cars&streets,&subjected to repeated rape, during the conflict In relation to #Syria,the #sec-gen has expressed concern about the sexual abuse of men in detention,as a method of extracting intelligence. #politicallymotivatedrape has also been part of political violence in #Libya, #Syria and #Egypt. Politically-motivated rape is a disturbing trend witnessed in the wake of contested elections in places such as Kenya, Guinea&C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire. Nor can we overlook the use or threat of #sexualviolence as a tool of political repression and civil strife. Impunity fuels the vicious cycle of violence. Peace is not only the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice. Modern history attests that ‚Äúpost-war‚Äù rarely means ‚Äúpost-rape‚Äù. In Liberia I've seen how #sexualviolence during war left a profound imprint A ceasefire does not mean peace for women if the shooting ceases, but the rapes continue unchecked. It is important not to exclude from consideration #conflictrelatedsexualviolence that continues after the guns fall silent. As a process of intimidation, #targetedrape is often a precursor to conflict, as well as the last weapon to be relinquished in its wake. But when #sexualviolence is driven by the dynamics of conflict, is systematic, constitutes a grave breach of International Humanitarian Law. Isolated acts of rape occur in all societies,in times of war or peace.These crimes need to be addressed by the national law&order machinery. Those who tolerate #sexualterror shd b on notice that they do so in defiance of the #securitycouncil w/ its power 2 enact enforcement msures A command structure with the capacity to sustain military operations and to punish deserters, has the capacity to rein in acts of rape. While not a panacea, the list reminds perpetrators that they can no longer sleep easily at night under the cover of impunity and anonymity. The message to armed groups is clear: The point is to cease all acts of rape, whether the victim is 8, 18 or 80. At its heart, Resolution 1960 is about prevention. It creates - for the first time - a workable system of deterrence and accountability. Rape is not over when it‚Äôs over. 2 better understand #sexualviolence&its consequences;to give rape a history,in order to deny it a future Collectively,they broke over 30 years of silence.I have urged the Governments of both Bosnia & Cambodia to deliver justice for these victims In Cambodia,women organized an informal hearing 2 spotlight #sexualviolence during the Khmer Rouge era left unaddressed by formal mechanisms From the Congo to Cambodia, from Bosnia to Liberia, these crimes have been neglected at the peace table and stricken from the public record. The report is also a historical record. This is critical, as the history of rape has been a history of denial. The acts of sexual torture& terror recorded here are not inevitable byproducts of war, but crimes committed by combatants&their commanders. These reports are also vehicles for putting names to some of history‚Äôs complex horrors. These reports do not just highlight horror stories; they are a place to feature the stories of actions that have made a difference. Today's Annual Report provides striking examples of #sexualviolence as a threat to security. No one can read this report and remain unmoved. In contemporary wars,it has become more dangerous to be a woman fetching water or collecting firewood,than to be a fighter on the frontline. Yet the #unsecuritycouncil has kept pace with the changing dynamics of conflict A decade ago, my mandate to be present in the #securitycouncil,addressing this subject, would have seemed improbable. In short: the #unsecuritycouncil has ushered in an ideological shift. And when it takes notice, so do others. The #unsecuritycouncil has led the way in recognizing that rape can acquire a strategic twist as a tactic of war #conflictrelatedsexualviolence is not specific to one country: it is a global risk. The terror of unarmed women facing armed men is age-old Earlier this month,a Guinean panel of judges charged LtCol.  Moussa Tiegboro Camara for his alleged role in the atrocities. This is progress As world public opinion applauded the commitments of the #unsecuritycouncil, intern'tl headlines told of soldiers raping in broad daylight The demonstration condemned mass rape by security forces in the small West African nation of Guinea On 30 September 2009, two dramatically different events took place: the adoption of Resolution 1888 & a demonstration, just outside the UN Reporting to the #securitycouncil right now on the UN's Secretary-General's Annual Report on #sexualviolenceinconflict This is the first report to name&shame perpetrators -- see my HuffingtonPost piece on #sexualviolence in conflict: http://t.co/aSVueYI0 Today is an important day -- briefing the #securitycouncil, whose members will decide our future mandate.

Women are leaders and activists, but can only reach their full potential when they feel safe. UN Security Council Resolutions 1325, 1820, 1888 and 1960 are key achievements, but we cannot afford to grow complacent. Much more is needed Political leaders throughout the world, spearheaded by the UN Security Council, have expressed their commitment to prevent #sexualviolence Together we must break down the walls of silence and shame surrounding #sexualviolence For too long, crimes of #sexualviolence have been perceived as inevitable, unspeakable and a lesser crime. These survivors, mainly women and girls, have lived through unspeakable horrors at the hands of armed groups On this day, I ask people to stand in solidarity with the survivors of #sexualviolence in conflict throughout the world Today we celebrate the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women ¬´ Vous √™tes leur espoir, elles viendront vers vous car elles ont confiance en vous.

I visited Guinea to meet with survivors, representatives of victims associations, and Government officials. The  legacy of 28 Sep '09 is far from over. There remains today an urgent need to assist the survivors and bring the perpetrators to justice Two years ago, the atrocities including mass rapes perpetrated against peaceful protesters in Guinea by security forces shocked the world I call on all people in positions of influence in Sierra Leone to speak up against using #sexualviolence as a tool of political intimidation Preventing #sexualviolence is particularly important as Sierra Leone is drawing closer to elections More needs to be done to support these survivors, both in terms of access to justice, services and to help them reintegrate into society Only a country thoroughly addressing the wrongdoings of the past can build a solid foundation for a successful and sustainable future But we must not ignore the past or forget the survivors of sexual violence in Sierra Leone. I understand that the country as a whole, incl. the Government of Sierra Leone, wants to look to the future, instead of dwelling on the past -- to gather a better understanding of how sexual violence during the war has influenced the society after the guns have fallen silent As part of an official visit to West Africa, I am currently in Sierra Leone -- a post-conflict country Swedish speaker?

I remind all parties that rape can be a crime against humanity, no less grave than other crimes,& that perpetrators will be held accountable authorities to investigate as a matter of urgency these alleged incidents with a view to holding the perpetrators accountable for these acts In line with the joint communiqu√© issued by the Government of Angola and the UN in March 2011, I call upon Angolan and Congolese authorities The most recent incidents would have occurred in the village of Tshiambi in the Republic of Angola between 4 and 7 October 2011 as they are expelled from Angola. These allegations include rape, beatings, looting and torture by security forces of the Governm. of Angola I am deeply concerned about allegations that Congolese migrants continue to be the targets of serious human rights violations It is crucial that these & other witnesses are afforded full legal protection,and I trust that relevant authorities will ensure their safety This case is another testament to the resilience of BiH women who have joined forces in their quest for justice, within&beyond the courtroom Ultimately, their actions contribute to strengthening the rule of law in Bosnia as a whole. I want to commend the courageous witnesses who have stepped forward to testify in this case. While this verdict is a positive step, the pace of justice for #sexualviolence survivors in BiH has been painfully slow Yet 16 years after the end of the war, there is still no justice for the majority of the approx. 50,000 women survivors of #sexualviolence Bosnia: I welcome the conviction today of Sasa Baricanin, who has finally been brought to justice for acts of #rape, murder and enslavement.

Prosecute all those suspected of abuse in accordance with int'l standards. I call upon the political authorities to break the vicious cycle of violence & impunity. Support the work of the independent panel of judges Dozens of public rapes & gang-rapes of women in broad daylight dramatically showed that sexual violence is not only a weapon in times of war Two years ago, the massacre of peaceful protesters by security forces in Guinea-Conakry shocked the world. Women were particularly targeted. Wangari Maathai - environmentalist & a fighter for women's rights - will be deeply missed, in Kenya & worldwide. Plant a tree in her honour! Beyond responding to sexual violence as a health issue, we have begun to identify ways to prevent it as a security threat. We must recognize these realities, and be prepared to meet head-on the challenge of ending sexual violence -- against women, men or children We have increasingly witnessed sexual violence in the context of political strife, fraught elections and post-election crises.

He was Chief of Staff, Guatemalan armed forces, '82-83 Any member of the military who preys upon, rather than protects, the population will likewise face serious consequences. All military forces in the DRC be aware that a Colonel was sentenced early 2011 to 20 yrs for crimes of #sexualviolence by his subordinates Crimes of this caliber are no accident‚Äìthey occur pursuant 2 orders or lax command&control. Commanders&perpetrators must be held accountable For our part, the UN is in the process of verifying these incidents and identifying ways to support the survivors. Primary responsibility rests with the DRC authorities for investigating this incident, pursuing the perpetrators & bringing them to justice. This mass rape which occurred from 10 to 12 June demonstrates a continuing pattern of ill-discipline on the part of those who bear arms I condemn in the strongest possible terms the mass rape of over 150 civilians, mainly women and girls, in the area of Minembwe, South Kivu Attending the ceremony for the appointment of Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General of the UN for a second term.
