https://t.co/CzLHk7yLnG Today’s opening of the Kerch bridge connecting Russia to illegally annexed Crimea constitutes yet another flagrant Russian violation of international law. New infrastructure will not change our view that #CrimeaIsUkraine https://t.co/lowwQh6LxD Tog emot Sveriges kristna råd för samtal om interreligiös dialog, hjälp och stöd till utsatta kristna och religiösa minoriteter i världen. Religionsfrihet är en mänsklig rättighet. https://t.co/5BYBkz6fRG Today Sweden has served 500 days in the Security Council.

Det är värt att uppmärksamma och fira. EU har gett oss och Europa fred, välstånd och demokrati. Samtidigt lever vi i en orolig tid där EU och våra gemensamma värderingar ifrågasätts. EU-samarbetet får inte tas för givet.

https://t.co/VvZZj5ACIr Snart avfärd mot Göteborg. Jag kommer bland annat besöka Jämställdhetsmyndigheten @jamy_sverige, och träffa studenter på @Handels_gbg  tillsammans med @mikaeldamberg.

As a long-time partner, Swe is concerned about reinstatement of the SoE. Continued reform efforts, inclusive dialogue, respect for rule of law and human rights, including freedom of expression should be a priority. The situation for the people in Syria continues to deteriorate and the world must act. UNSC resolution, put forward by Sweden &amp; Kuwait, aims to enable humanitarian help to those in need. I count on the UNSC to shoulder its responsibility. OS-silver! Grattis Charlotte Kalla och Stina Nilsson! https://t.co/zmFDpCAD9I Äntligen framme vid vinter-OS i Pyeongchang för några intensiva timmars besök. Har bland annat hunnit träffa Damkronorna och damcurlinglandslaget. https://t.co/1kBZtQuBzo Alarming military escalation in Syria, particularly the attacks on civilians in eastern Ghouta and Idlib. Echo call by the UN and the EU for decrease of violence, protection of civilians, full respect for international law and immediate, full and sustained humanitarian access. https://t.co/iS2m4r7x5C Visited Panmunjom in South Korea to get some firsthand impressions at the border. Very proud of the Swedish staff at the NNSC and their important work along the demilitarized zone in support of peace. https://t.co/EGJYFMGf9b Successful first day in Seoul, meeting with my dear colleague FM Kang. On the agenda the situation on the Korean Peninsula and our excellent bilateral relation. https://t.co/nxdwaX7dso Just landat i Sydkorea. Ser fram emot att få träffa utrikesminister Kang. Många angelägna frågor på dagordningen. Inte minst situationen på koreanska halvön, men vi har också en hel del aktuella bilaterala frågor att prata om. Jag tillhör den generation som växte upp under det ständigt närvarande hotet om ett globalt kärnvapenkrig. Nu, när kärnvapnen har gjort återkomst på den storpolitiska arenan, stärker regeringen det breda arbetet för nedrustning. 

https://t.co/R0hbif033V Åker idag till Sydkorea för möten om situationen på koreanska halvön och ett besök vid vinter-OS i #Pyeongchang för att på plats stödja våra svenska atleter. 
Men först: Nyhetsmorgon med @JesperBrjesson. I studion kl 10.15.
https://t.co/F8Whyf8TaD Congratulations Kosovo on your 10th anniversary! Crucial steps have been taken in Kosovo’s state-building since independence, despite challenges. Sweden continues to support efforts for stability, prosperity and a better future. Congratulations Lithuania on your 100th anniversary of the restoration of the State. I wish you wonderful centennial celebrations. #LT100 #RestoredLithuania100 @LinkeviciusL My best wishes to President Ramaphosa on his election today. Sweden and #SouthAfrica have strong, close and long-standing relations. Looking forward to further deepening our partnership on global challenges. Important statement from HRVP @FedericaMog on Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, detained in China. https://t.co/U7s78t7ldn Saddened to learn about the passing of Morgan Tsvangirai. A strong political leader and a brave defender of democracy and rule of law in #Zimbabwe. Cyberattacks, initiated by states or their proxies, pose a growing threat to individual states and to international peace and security. We will continue to work for a global, open and peaceful cyberspace, fully respecting international law. In Sofia, Bulgaria for the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers. Syria, W Balkans and North Korea to be discussed. Also a discussion about security and defence with the EU candidate countries. Tack @upflund och @Lundsuni för det varma mottagandet. Stort intresse för utrikespolitik och många intressanta frågor. #utrdekl18 https://t.co/vyvolFZS56 Landat i soligt Skåne. Ser mycket fram emot att snart vara tillbaka i Lund för att diskutera utrikespolitik med studenterna vid @Lundsuni! https://t.co/vN0HHHwPdD Regeringens utrikespolitiska deklaration kan läsas i efterhand här https://t.co/9ITRxsRA0u.

https://t.co/lHNehGgfeB As always good to talk and laugh with my Lithuanian colleague @LinkeviciusL. https://t.co/FM1dbrTVnB Situation in Myanmar remains deeply concerning. Welcome discussion in #UNSC today w focus on conditions for voluntary, secure, dignified and sustainable return of refugees. UN engagement critical, Security Council must remain seized. Idag hålls ett viktigt möte i FN:s säkerhetsråd om Myanmar, på initiativ av Sverige och andra länder. https://t.co/kmoAZZl7Gz Grattis Stina Nilsson till guldet! Och grattis hela svenska OS-truppen till ännu en medalj! 🇸🇪🥇 Medborgarna i DR Kongo måste få välja sina ledare. Omvärldens enade budskap viktigt: trovärdiga val behöver genomföras i december. Därför arrangerade sju medlemmar i FN:s säkerhetsråd, inklusive Sverige, ett informellt möte i New York idag till stöd för valprocessen. https://t.co/bauHsSVHyZ Ser mycket fram emot att prata utrikespolitik med studenter i Lund på onsdag! https://t.co/vN0HHHwPdD My heartfelt condolences to the families and relatives of the victims of the tragic plane crash outside Moscow. A global advocate for #HumanRights sadly passes away. @Asma_Jahangir, founder of @HRCP_PK and longtime President of Pakistan's Supreme Court dedicated her life to the protection of human rights. She left us in midst of her mandate as UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Iran Worrying developments between Syria and Israel. Urge all to respect int'l law, show restraint &amp; avoid actions that further escalate the situation. Must urgently refocus efforts to end the conflict in Syria, where the UN-led political process remains the only viable path. Då är OS i #PyeongChang2018 igång. Jag vill passa på att önska den svenska OS-truppen all lycka till. Heja Sverige!🇸🇪 Launching State of the Nordic Region report by @Nordregio today in Stockholm. A gold mine of facts and figures on the Nordic region. Read it here: https://t.co/ddYz2Qk8Lr?amp=1 https://t.co/yNFPc19Qa8 State of the Nordic Region: Sweden has the highest rate of employment in the EU, not least due to the high level of participation of women in the labour market. #Norden2018 @Nordregio https://t.co/WyKC8vRLpP Proud to present the ”State of the Nordic Region 2018” from @nordregio today along with my fellow ministers for Nordic cooperation.

Recommended reading in @csmonitor: https://t.co/cAFWT5QgoE Idag i Stockholm: Första mötet för de nordiska samarbetsministrarna under det svenska ordförandeskapet i Nordiska ministerrådet 2018. Ett inkluderande, innovativt och tryggt Norden är visionen för vårt ordförandeskap. #Norden2018 The international community must heed the calls from humanitarian actors on the ground in Syria. Together with Kuwait, we have requested a #UNSC meeting tomorrow to address the urgent humanitarian situation &amp; recent escalation of violence. https://t.co/cGwCnotN5t Säkerhetsrådet idag: Viktig diskussion om arbetsmetoder. Sverige verkar för ett mer resultatinriktat, effektivt och transparent arbete i rådet som öppnar upp för civilsamhället. Welcome new #EU #WesternBalkans strategy. The future of the region as an integral part of the EU is in the Union's very own political, security and economic interest. 
https://t.co/tDXM0Hb6si Today is the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. More than 200 million women and girls in the world have undergone #FGM. This practice is a human rights violation that must end everywhere. https://t.co/UZZPGK8m67 Sanctions is an important instrument to restore peace and security. Sweden as chair of UN Security Council’s #Mali Sanctions Committee warmly welcomes Panel of Experts with mandate to assist in monitoring implementation of sanctions to support the peace process. #SwedeninUNSC Sverige verkar sedan en tid aktivt för ett nytt möte i säkerhetsrådet om situationen i Myanmar. Viktigt att det internationella trycket på Myanmar upprätthålls. Today the Berlin Wall has been gone for 28 years, 2 months and 26 days - just as long as it stood. A day to remember why we continue our work for a united, open and peaceful Europe. Min vän Joost, överlevare och en av de sista rösterna som själv bär vittnesbörd om det fasansfulla dåd nazismen gjorde sig skyldig till, bor i Säffle och det kändes viktigt att få träffa honom. Joost fyller i år 95 år och föreläser fortfarande om tiden i läger. https://t.co/kz5IRDJKMS Vi kräver att Gui Minhai får träffa svensk diplomatisk och medicinsk personal, och att han frisläpps så att han kan återförenas med sin familj.

https://t.co/mU1t3EGDV6 Mitt besök på Herrgårdsgymnasiet i Säffle inleddes med en god lunch tillsammans med elevrådet. Här finns menyn på fyra språk. https://t.co/S8utlZIHGV Besöker idag Karlstad, Grums och Säffle. Många spännande möten och samtal. Här med elever på Herrgårdsgymnasiet i Säffle. https://t.co/VGRLJDRk7q - Andras öden är också våra öden. Vi måste finna gemensamma lösningar. Inledde min dag på hemmaplan med att möta studenter på Karlstads Universitet. https://t.co/ahzKRC88vW @owenil @viktorbk Så sant! Disturbing news of mass graves in Myanmar. This reinforces Sweden’s strong conviction to the importance of investigating crimes against humanity in Myanmar. Perpetrators must be held accountable. Impunity cannot be an option. Welcoming my friend and colleague Aurelia Frick, FM of Liechtenstein, to Sweden today. Discussions on the future of Europe, work for women’s rights and many other issues. https://t.co/X8rNedib8D Contemporary challenges to peace &amp; security require new approaches. #UNSC today adopted new presidential statement on #WestAfrica &amp; #Sahel: commending @UN_UNOWAS, recognizing adverse effects of #climatechange + illustrating need to tackle root causes of crises. Important step! Important UN Security Council unity during today’s mandate renewal for UN Mission in #Cyprus; urging the sides to renew commitment to settlement, highlighting need for trust-building between communities and full participation of women and civil society in the peace process. Hedrad att få hälsa Palmepristagarna Hédi Fried och Emerich Roth välkomna till @Utrikesdep idag. De är båda sanna hjältar vars bidrag i kampen mot antisemitism är ovärderligt. Det är allas vårt ansvar att stå upp mot hatet. https://t.co/ABlTQWOXRu Welcomed FM of Kosovo @pacollibehgjet in Stockholm today. Full support for Kosovo’s EU integration. Implementation of reforms &amp; honouring of political agreements crucial to move ahead. https://t.co/P8zRNKnrUk Mina varmaste gratulationer till president Niinistö till vinsten i det finska presidentvalet, brett folkligt stöd och starkt förtroende. 
Ser fram emot fortsatt nära samarbete mellan våra länder. Regrettable that once again peaceful demonstrators are detained in Russia when exercising fundamental freedom of expression &amp; assembly. Expect Russia to live up to its international obligations and protect these rights. Particularly worrisome in view of presidential election. Ingvar Kamprad har gått bort. Han satte i allra högsta grad Sverige på världskartan. En fantastisk entreprenör som bidrog till att föra Sverige ut i världen. Mina tankar är hos hans familj och anhöriga. Condemning the heinous terrorist attack in Kabul. A cowardice act killing and injuring many innocent civilian bystanders. Sympathies with the victims and the Afghan people. Today is the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is our responsibility to learn from this dark chapter in history. Yesterday I hosted the 2018 Holocaust Remembrance Lecture at @SweMFA w Professor Yehuda Bauer. My speech:
https://t.co/wmkGEUFsHX Idag skriver min kollega Finlands utrikesminister på DN Debatt. Vi har ett nära och starkt samarbete som ständigt utvecklas. https://t.co/WyPEx8VSDx Sweden hosts an informal meeting on Yemen today together with key European partners. Important discussions on a conflict which has lead to the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian disasters. The EU has an important role to play. Important and touching meeting today with Professor Yehuda Bauer, who has done amazing work with Sweden in the fight against anti-Semitism. His efforts for prevention of genocide are invaluable. https://t.co/ISkFCswhc2 Warm congratulations to @Dunja_Mijatovic , elected new @coe Commissioner for Human Rights. An excellent choice! Feministisk utrikespolitik i praktiken.

Regeringen har idag beslutat att Sverige ska stödja FN med genderkompetens genom att erbjuda utbildningsplatser vid Försvarsmaktens centrum för implementering av genderperspektiv i militära operationer.

https://t.co/wg0csE77Wb Appalled by the cowardly attack on #SaveTheChildren in Afghanistan. International humanitarian law must be upheld. Our thoughts are with victims and families. Inspiring to meet with our women's mediation network. These women are active in Syria, Afghanistan, Colombia and other places. More women more peace. https://t.co/saamk7CUeR Nu utökar vi nätverket av kvinnliga medlare. Det finns en stor internationell efterfrågan. 

https://t.co/m1YE0wukZa Not so unexpected if you ask me. https://t.co/jh39vQQedP I welcome the initiative by FM @JY_LeDrian to found an international partnership against impunity for the use of chemical weapons. 

We trust that this will be an important and useful way to support and complement the multilateral process. https://t.co/oKqqCo6uYD Inspiring meeting with female ambassadors in Paris, hosted by @AmbassadeurSE, @SwedeninFR. Discussions on feminist foreign policy, #metoo and much more. https://t.co/gqaIc8YRyS Launching today: Partnership Against Impunity for the use of Chemical Weapons. 

100 years after the end of WW1, we must learn the lessons of history and ensure that there can be no impunity for the use of chemical weapons. https://t.co/rUssaOVgLy In Brussels for the EU Foreign Ministers meeting. Discussions on Libya and EU relations with ACP-states. Foreign Ministers also meeting Palestinian President Abbas for a discussion on the Middle East peace process. #FAC Disturbing news from Ingushetia, where office of Russian human rights NGO Memorial has been subject to arson attack – yet another blow to work of civil society in North Caucasus. The safety and rights of Russian civil society actors across the country must be ensured. It is a moral &amp; humanitarian responsibility to address the risks that weapons of mass destruction poses to the world. Building trust on these issues is key for our common security. https://t.co/p7ewTWAt6S Gratulerar @jantoresanner som ny nordisk samarbetsminister! Jag ser fram emot fortsatt gott samarbete med Norge. #norden2018 Den här veckan märks regeringens skattesänkning för 75% av alla personer över 65 år. Är oerhört stolt över den här reformen som handlar om rättvisa mellan generationer. De som lagt grunden för vår gemensamma välfärd förtjänar respekt. https://t.co/csgYSJu2Zn Roligt att i samband med det isländska statsbesöket få bjuda utrikesministerkollegan @GudlaugurThor på lunch på UD. Viktigt att nordiskt samarbete hålls högt på dagordningen. https://t.co/gFzGDzOk0T Avslöjande i pldebatten idag: Kristerssons oförmåga att förklara hur M vill minska klimatutsläppen. Dessutom att han talade om 60 miljarder av skattebetalarnas pengar till Nya Karolinska sjukhuset som ett "husbygge i Solna". M i Stockholms läns landsting är ansvariga för haveriet Strongly condemn murder of Oliver Ivanovic. Condolences to family and friends. Important for all to show calm and restraint &amp; for perpetrators to be brought to justice. 
https://t.co/UjcvXegmb3 Following with concern reports on recent attacks by ELN in Colombia. I urge the parties to resume formal negotiations and renew ceasefire. Sweden is committed to the  peacebuilding process. UNSG   Guterres' visit showed the UN commitment to the Colombian people and peace. @ditmirbushati @AlbanianDiplo @AlEmbassySweden @SwedeninAL @SweMFA @OdetBarbullushi @jndisi @endrifuga @kryeministriaal @EdliraPrendi Thank you Ditmir. It was great to have you here in Stockholm. Strong support from Sweden for Albanias EU reform efforts. All the best. Här är mitt tal från igår på Folk och försvars rikskonferens. 
https://t.co/H122shFxUe En fullspäckad dag i Sälen idag på Folk och försvars rikskonferens. Intressanta tal, diskussioner och samtal om försvars- och säkerhetspolitiken #fofrk https://t.co/p5FBDL0c0O Good news that Sweden – yet again – is placed in the top ten of Monocle’s annual Soft Power Index. 
https://t.co/JbORCVlHl2 I welcome the decision of the Constitutional Court of Turkey to release journalists Sahin Alpay and Mehmet Altan. Very good news. Following with great concern reports on the detention of Russian human rights activist Oyub Titiev (Memorial Organization) in Chechnya.
I call on the Russian authorities to fully ensure the protection of his rights. Civil society must be allowed to operate without harassment. Today is the 25th birthday of the Barents Cooperation. Regional cooperation and people-to-people contacts have made the Barents Cooperation a success story. @barents_beac During the Olympics of Ancient Greece the cessation of hostilities between states was known as the Olympic truce. I welcome inter Korean talks today and look forward to seeing DPRK team in Winter Olympics. Let us hope that the Olympic truce can turn into peace. Welcoming five EU Human Rights Ambassadors and @SJLambrinidis for talks in Stockholm on EU work to protect and promote universal #HumanRights. EU’s voice is key and its impact rests on coherence and unity. https://t.co/6HgQHevQIW Important meeting today with Rabbi Michael Melchior on the crucial issues of Middle East peace, combatting antisemitism, the importance of supporting dialogue and the way forward for a two-state solution. https://t.co/oByXq2LiaC Mer än 800 journalister har mördats det senaste årtiondet. Nio av tio mord har ännu inte klarats upp. Regeringen stärker nu det internationella arbetet för att skydda journalisters säkerhet. https://t.co/juq4MUQE76 Vi hävdar principerna om demokrati och respekt för mänskliga rättigheter och rättsstatens principer. Det är oacceptabelt med dödsfall, massarresteringar och inskränkningar av internet så som
skett i Iran. 
https://t.co/ixiGLngLV4 Idag är det 100 år sedan Sverige erkände Finland som självständig stat, och vi firar i dagarna 100 år av diplomatiska förbindelser med vårt nära och kära grannland. Resumed Korean hotline and possibly DPRK in Olympics most positive. Still time for diplomacy. Urge all parties to support peace. Efter ett år i säkerhetsrådet kan vi konstatera att Sverige gör skillnad. Arbetet fortsätter för en tryggare värld, och därmed för ett tryggare Sverige. https://t.co/7IJxKioVb2 Happy New Year and best wishes for 2018! ✨ Following demonstrations in Iran. Important that further violence is avoided. Freedom of assembly is a basic human right. Congratulations #Liberia to peaceful elections and historic democratic transfer of power to president-elect @GeorgeWeahOff. Lyssna gärna på mitt program av Dagboken i @sverigesradio P4 med programledaren Emma Hagberg. Ett timmeslångt samtal som utgår ifrån gamla dagboksantekningar.  

https://t.co/0s4goO6ceK Sverige är ordförande i fem regionala samarbeten under året som kommer. Vårt ledarskap ska präglas av samarbete, dialog och diplomati. Bara så kan vi säkra freden på sikt. https://t.co/YJXA6pr9gS #Hammarskjöld resolution with 113 cosponsors adopted in consensus. Continued investigation crucial. Sweden will appoint high-ranking official to review archives and urge other UN Member States to do the same. We have a shared responsibility to pursue the full truth. God jul! https://t.co/LmwWHYlPyw Mycket glädjande att Seidou har släppts fri och nu kan återförenas med sin familj. #UNSC unanimously adopt new sanctions against DPRK today in response to latest missile launch. Provocations must cease and diplomatic efforts must be enhanced. https://t.co/8cki4HXi5u Welcome clear majority support for UNGA resolution on #Jerusalem today. More important than ever to work for a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as the future capital of both states. Mycket bra möte idag med överbefälhavare Micael Bydén. Viktigt att träffas regelbundet för att diskutera frågor om Sveriges säkerhet. https://t.co/TIDipuTAcO Sweden is proud to have facilitated extension of resolution 2165, with Japan &amp; Egypt. Through extension the #UNSC maintains a lifeline for millions of people in Syria. https://t.co/VCEIi3DYIc Regeringen har nominerat @regner_asa för uppdraget som biträdande chef för @UNWomen. En stark kandidat som kommer att göra ett utmärkt arbete. Kvinnors rättigheter är mänskliga rättigheter, och en jämställd värld är en bättre värld för alla. https://t.co/WrpBw4gz6e Welcome the start of #SouthSudan High-Level Revitalisation Forum in Addis Ababa. Priority to ensure end of hostilities, humanitarian access, and an inclusive peace process. Strong support by #UNSC, #EU. https://t.co/RsFmdafFUw Sexualbrotten ökar i Sverige och yngre kvinnor är mest utsatta. Sex ska vara frivilligt. Om det inte är frivilligt så är det olagligt. https://t.co/ViTf8MwUTt Word of the year 2017 according to @MerriamWebster dictionary:

https://t.co/sVU97I0DT0 Very good discussions with UN Deputy Secretary-General @AminaJMohammed on UN reform, climate &amp; security and much more. https://t.co/RBz9dsdTsG Now: Meeting on links between climate and security. How can the Security Council use its unique role within the UN system to prevent climate change-induced conflicts? Follow on @UNWebTV https://t.co/AmBXEkBMHd Meeting US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson before the #UNSC meeting on North Korea today. https://t.co/IAFKVv8IDK Good discussion with Secretary-General @antonioguterres and Ukrainian Foreign Minister @PavloKlimkin before today’s meeting. Council unified on the gravity of the situation and in condemning DPRK provocations. https://t.co/z7Mg20MEF1 We have to exhaust every avenue for diplomacy and dialogue. Efforts are urgent. The consequences of failure would be disastrous. 
My speech at #UNSC meeting on North Korea today: https://t.co/DQpEU9jj5g Meeting the UN correspondents ahead of today’s meeting on North Korea in the #UNSC. https://t.co/TRNBnEWDnR Hjälp @ssu_sverige att samla in mer pengar än @mufswe till @musikhjalpen! Barn är inte till salu. Gå in och swisha: https://t.co/eFMPrdX8hU #mh17 https://t.co/F9XKHpL9nU Deeply concerned about the arrest of the two journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo on Tuesday in Yangon, Myanmar. Press freedom and the rule of law are fundamental – journalists must be able to work freely without intimidation. Klimatförändringar påverkar miljontals människors tillgång till rent vatten och leder till ökad konkurrens om redan knappa resurser. På så vis är klimatförändringar ett tydligt hot mot internationell fred och säkerhet. https://t.co/ALwucF9DzS Välförtjänt att årets Palmepris går till Hédi Fried och Emerich Roth. Deras arbete för att sprida kunskap om nazismens fruktansvärda illdåd är ovärderligt. Det är allas vårt ansvar att bekämpa hatet. Jag vill gärna rekommendera läsning av Frieds ”Frågor jag fått om förintelsen”. #UNSC meeting on North Korea, informal meeting on climate &amp; security, bilateral meetings and meetings with civil society over the coming days in New York. https://t.co/Y2R0WRoPup #SwedeninUNSC Glad to have met with OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, @harlemdesir . Discussions on the worrying global trend of shrinking media freedom and increasing threats to journalists. https://t.co/7GHxQ6BrDU Good discussion with civil society representatives on #SwedeninUNSC in Stockholm yesterday. International peace and security matters to all – thanks for sharing your perspectives! https://t.co/cWrisR9ziU Best wishes to everyone celebrating #Hanukkah, in Sweden and around the world! Congratulations to ICAN on receiving the Nobel peace prize for their important work on a nuclear ban treaty. The world cannot truly rest until nuclear weapons have been abolished. In Brussels for the monthly EU Foreign Ministers’ meeting. The Middle East, Africa, PESCO on the agenda. I wish everyone attending or following the #NobelPrize celebrations in Stockholm a joyous and memorable night. In a world where human rights, democracy and the rule of law are pushed back, Sweden works harder to protect and promote equal rights for all. #HumanRightsDay The attack against the Synagogue in Gothenburg and calls for violence against Jews in Malmö are deplorable and totally unacceptable. Anti-Semitism, threats and violence have no place in our society. Welcome announcement by Iraqi PM al-Abadi that the war against ISIL/Daesh in #Iraq is over. Sweden has contributed as part of the Coalition. Important to focus on stabilising areas liberated. Sweden and the EU remains committed to continue supporting Iraq in crucial times ahead. Fullständigt oacceptabelt. Hot, hat och antisemitism har ingen plats i vårt samhälle. https://t.co/nlhqlhwlI0 Echo SG @antonioguterres’s statement. Attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law. My thoughts with the victims’ families &amp; brave MONUSCO staff. https://t.co/bOyEQmHwhr #UNSC adopts resolution on #G5Sahel Joint Force, supporting regional efforts for security &amp; development + peace process in #Mali. The UN Security Council convened today for an extraordinary meeting on Jerusalem. All parties must refrain from the use of violence. Sweden calls on all stakeholders to engage in efforts to achieve peace. 
https://t.co/aALtyGpgQR Strongly condemn last night’s attack on United Nations peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. https://t.co/3unwyPF9C0 #Jerusalem discussion in the UN Security Council today, at request of Sweden &amp; 7 other council members. As future capital of both Israel &amp; Palestine, its status can only be resolved through negotiations. All stakeholders must engage in advancing peace. Violence must be avoided. Very good meeting with US colleague Rex Tillerson in Vienna. Discussions about cooperation on North Korea and Ukraine issues. Also discussed status of Jerusalem. The Transatlantic link remains strong and important for Sweden and the US. https://t.co/ifzLbf4SW9 Breakfast meeting with Crimean Tatars. Grim stories from a reality of imprisonment and repression from Russian authorities. #CrimeaIsUkraine https://t.co/I8KFnlEPbf At #OSCE ministerial meeting in Vienna. Dialogue in OSCE is crucial and must be based on Helsinki and Paris principles. The OSCE must be the guardian of the rules-based order. Giving up on principles means less security. #OSCEMC17 Sweden and other council members have requested that an emergency meeting on Jerusalem takes place this week. https://t.co/MSqm4rLLHl Vital to protect #Jerusalem’s special status as established by the #UN and respect #UNSC resolutions. Clear EU position on Jerusalem as a final status issue and future capital for two states. Unilateral action on Jerusalem jeopardises peace and stability in region and beyond. Well deserved! https://t.co/gYjaPxb5i9 Grattis Finland på 100-årsdagen! Idag firar vi att det är 100 år sedan Finland vann sin självständighet. Sverige och Finland är och kommer att fortsätta vara goda grannar med ett nära samarbete. Good discussions on Sweden-NATO cooperation with Deputy Secretary-General @Gottemoeller in Brussels. Welcoming renewal of Sweden’s status as Enhanced Opportunities Partner. https://t.co/j7LEnyypGL Systematic use of force, intimidation and sexual and gender based violence against #Rohingya must end. Impunity for human rights violations and abuses is not an option. Clear message from Sweden at @UNHumanRights session today. Great to meet @cafreeland at Nato foreign ministers meeting today for discussions on Women Peace &amp; Security and much more. https://t.co/ZRFdvuEZZj Några klargöranden med anledning av rapportering om bristande diarieföring på UD och säkerhetsrådskandidaturen.

https://t.co/8iroS54JMM EU foreign ministers meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Brussels today. https://t.co/QX7La8ju2m On my way to Brussels for the NATO foreign ministers meeting. European security, Baltic Sea security situation and EU NATO cooperation to be discussed. Kandidaturen till säkerhetsrådet har granskats noga av konstitutionsutskottet, utrikesutskottet och av UD internt. Inga felaktigheter kunde hittas. https://t.co/U5HheXk8r7 Good news! @BarackObama proposes a feminist foreign policy? https://t.co/sS7Ry1ZgpF Condemn recent violence in #Yemen. All parties must show restraint, de-escalate and engage in political dialogue. Fully support UNSG @antonioguterres call to cease air and ground assaults, resume commercial imports and protect civilians. Important meeting in #UNSC tomorrow. https://t.co/NA0hYecwdG Påståenden om att UD skulle ha undanhållit information är felaktiga. Offentlighetsprincipen gäller. Jag har gett UD:s rättschef i uppdrag att tillsätta en arbetsgrupp som ska presentera åtgärder för att rutiner bättre ska följas. https://t.co/8iroS54JMM Deltar i morgon i Natos utrikesministermöte i Bryssel. På agendan: europeisk säkerhet, samarbetet mellan EU och Nato samt säkerhetssituationen i Östersjöregionen. https://t.co/O8l4zEL2Ys Today is the International day for Abolition of Slavery. Together we must continue the fight against slavery and human trafficking. Had hoped to see journalist Khadija Ismayilova receive #RightLivelihoodAward in Stockholm today. Regret Azerbaijan authorities did not allow her to travel to Sweden. Destruction and trafficking of cultural heritage by terrorist groups and in armed conflict require accountability. Important discussion in the #UNSC today. https://t.co/VYTTQ1HtXM Hedrar idag också minnet av Dagmars far Ragnar, som vigde sitt liv åt att få klarhet i dotterns öde och att utkräva ansvar för brottet. 2/2 Välkomnar domen mot förövarna bakom Dagmar Hagelins försvinnande. Hon rövades bort och mördades 1977 av argentinska militärjuntan, som ett av tusentals offer. Straffrihet får aldrig accepteras.  1/2 70 years ago, Sweden voted in favor of UNGA resolution 181, establishing the foundation of the two-state solution in the Middle East. We firmly believed then, and still do today, that a two-state solution is the way forward.

Joint op-ed w/ General Sir Richard Shirreff, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe NATO in #HuffPo on #sexualviolence: http://t.co/KB784bgd My office and our Team of Experts on the Rule of Law look forward to working strategically with the UK special rapid deployment unit. Prosecution of sexual violence is also prevention,as it sends a strong signal to perpetrators that impunity isn't an option for these crimes I also welcome the announcement that the UK intends to use its G8 presidency next year to draw attention to the issue of #sexualviolence I welcome today's announcement by the UK Government to create a special rapid deployment unit to collect evidence on acts of #sexualviolence The forgotten Khmer Rouge #sexualviolence victims: op-ed in The Phnom Penh Post: http://t.co/jKZ4rRgC At American Chamber of Commerce in Sweden's 20th anniv. event,talking abt #sexualviolence to an audience probably more used to other issues At the Swedish Defence College giving a lecture about #sexualviolence in conflict to two dozen Flag Officers from several countries. I understand that Colombia wants to look to the future, instead of dwelling on the past. But there can be no peace without peace for women. Meeting w/ survivors of #sexualviolence in Colombia today. Upsetting stories abt disappearances,killings,rapes,threats agnst women activists Rueda de prensa en Bogota http://t.co/09gnHut3 Reunión con el Sr. Vicepresidente de la República Colombiana, Angelino Garzón En una invitación oficial del Gobierno Nacional, estoy en misión en Colombia de cuatro días sobre #violenciasexual. #IPLEDGE:Support the Nobel Women's Initiative week of action 6-13 May to stop rape&amp;gender violence in conflict @ http://t.co/szuUiArE. Both have been sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council for various violations including #sexualviolence crimes Once again, a new wave of violence is being perpetrated by actors such as the Mai Mai leader Sheka Ntabo Ntaberi and Gen. Bosco Ntaganda The fighting between government forces, dissident groups and militia is again causing immense suffering for civilians I am deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (#DRC) following intense fighting Today's judgment against #CharlesTaylor sets a powerful precedent for all commanders and combatants Acts of #sexualviolence included but were not limited to rapes of 100s of women and girls by members of AFRC/RUF rebels at various locations #CharlesTaylor is guilty of aiding&abetting, as well as planning the commission of, all 11 counts of war crimes or crimes against humanity. Allegations in the #CharlesTaylor case go back to 1996,& today's judgment proves that although justice has been delayed it cannot be denied These acts are not only crimes against the victims, but crimes against humanity. The #CharlesTaylor case signals to the women, children and communities affected by #sexualviolence that the world is watching. I have heard firsthand the stories of these survivors when I visited Sierra Leone last year. The #CharlesTaylor trial may appear to concern just one perpetrator, but it gives voice to all survivors. When I took up office as UN Special Representative on #sexualviolence in Conflict two years ago, I made addressing impunity my top priority The successful prosecution of a former President signals that no leader–however powerful–is above the law;&that no woman or girl is below it Judgment of #CharlesTaylor: Today represents a milestone in the history of international criminal justice The Taylor judgment is about to be pronounced http://t.co/5aFGWqeW In Leidschendam (in the Hague), awaiting the judgment of #CharlesTaylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. #sexualviolence isn't limited to any culture/ context.It happens in conflict,post-conflict situations&in the context of pol.strife Conflict-related #sexualviolence affects not only the individual but the whole construction of society, tearing entire societies apart. Using #sexualviolence against women means targeting the backbone of society as women often bear the primary responsibility for the family. The myth that #sexualviolence would be a lesser crime is not shared by survivors: "They have taken my life without killing me." The shame and the stigma surrounding the issue of #sexualviolence must end and perpetrators be held accountable for their misdeeds. In the words of one Libyan survivor of #sexualviolence: "If the bleeding had stopped, I would never have reported it." Very often, the blame falls on the survivors of #sexualviolence. They have to bear the shame while the perpetrators go free. Conflict-related #sexualviolence is surrounded by several myths and misconceptions: That it'd be inevitable, unspeakable and a lesser crime. RW's briefcase seems left in a hurry, as a representation of his unfinished work. His actions show the difference one individual can make. As I look out of my office window each morning,I see a monument facing the UN building. At the foot of it,there's a briefcase w/ initials RW Leaving Lund, where Raoul Wallenberg was commemorated yesterday with Raoul's 91 year old sister Nina Lagergren, Navi Pillay & Kofi Annan Are you in the UK or can watch BBC News? If so, tune in for a live interview about Syria right now We continue to monitor the situation in Mali and in other conflicts where #sexualviolence may occur,& stand in solidarity with the survivors Any peaceful solution in #Mali achieved through political dialogue must include women and must address the crime of #rape. Sexual violence in Mali contributes to the destabilization of the region and the denial of women’s rights. Acts of cnflct-reltd #sexualviolence can constitute war crimes or crimes ag hum. 4 which combatants&their commanders will be held to account Any party to the conflict credibly suspected of committing/responsible for patterns of rape&othr formsof #sexualviolence can be named&shamed I condemn in the strongest possible terms every incident of alleged sexual violence committed against Malian women and girls. As unrest continues in northern Mali, an alarming number of acts of #sexualviolence have been reported, including public rapes.

The world is watching. While #sexualviolence disproportionately affects women and girls, men and boys also number among the direct and indirect victims. I'm particlrly concerned that unless women can shape their own polit'cl&pers'nl destiny,the #arabspring will turn in2 a winter 4 #Arab women Women have fought daily wars - not for medals&monuments - but battles for bread,battles to feed their children,& to make their presence felt We must send a message that women’s lives and votes and voices count, and will be counted. Rape has a chilling effect on women’s pol prtciption,casting a long shadow of trauma,inhibiting their access 2 polling booths&public squares The aim is not only to protect women from #sexualviolence; it is to protect them to participate in public and economic life. The #UN #securitycouncil has understood that there can be no security without women’s security. We also know that #militarized #mining can fuel #humanrights violations by enriching armed groups, for instance in the #DRC In #Somalia,a practice has recently been detected of nat'l sec forces renting out their uniforms 2 civilians by night,which facilitates rape #sexualviolence is often perpetuated by incomplete disarmament and the absence of vetting, training and security sector reform. The proliferation of #smallarmsandlightweapons enable these atrocities. As many women have told me: “That man had the gun,&he had the power” #conflictrelatedsexualviolence is not a “fact of human history”, like disease or drought; it is often planned and therefore predictable. Improved data-collection is therefore inextricably linked w/ improved assistance.Our primary focus must always be needs, rather than numbers Due to the blame, shame and stigma, most survivors still have more to lose than to gain from reporting rape. The relationship betw incidents&reports of #wartimerape is like the relatshp between the tip&the mass of an iceberg=only extremity's visible This underscores that we cannot wait for hard data on #sexualviolence to surface before taking action Yet survivors r only coming forward in cases of urgt medic need.A Libyan victim:“If the bleeding had stopped,I would never have reported it” In #Libya,UN info indicates a pattern of women being abducted from their homes,cars&streets,&subjected to repeated rape, during the conflict In relation to #Syria,the #sec-gen has expressed concern about the sexual abuse of men in detention,as a method of extracting intelligence. #politicallymotivatedrape has also been part of political violence in #Libya, #Syria and #Egypt. Politically-motivated rape is a disturbing trend witnessed in the wake of contested elections in places such as Kenya, Guinea&Côte d’Ivoire. Nor can we overlook the use or threat of #sexualviolence as a tool of political repression and civil strife. Impunity fuels the vicious cycle of violence. Peace is not only the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice. Modern history attests that “post-war” rarely means “post-rape”. In Liberia I've seen how #sexualviolence during war left a profound imprint A ceasefire does not mean peace for women if the shooting ceases, but the rapes continue unchecked. It is important not to exclude from consideration #conflictrelatedsexualviolence that continues after the guns fall silent. As a process of intimidation, #targetedrape is often a precursor to conflict, as well as the last weapon to be relinquished in its wake. But when #sexualviolence is driven by the dynamics of conflict, is systematic, constitutes a grave breach of International Humanitarian Law. Isolated acts of rape occur in all societies,in times of war or peace.These crimes need to be addressed by the national law&order machinery. Those who tolerate #sexualterror shd b on notice that they do so in defiance of the #securitycouncil w/ its power 2 enact enforcement msures A command structure with the capacity to sustain military operations and to punish deserters, has the capacity to rein in acts of rape. While not a panacea, the list reminds perpetrators that they can no longer sleep easily at night under the cover of impunity and anonymity. The message to armed groups is clear: The point is to cease all acts of rape, whether the victim is 8, 18 or 80. At its heart, Resolution 1960 is about prevention. It creates - for the first time - a workable system of deterrence and accountability. Rape is not over when it’s over. 2 better understand #sexualviolence&its consequences;to give rape a history,in order to deny it a future Collectively,they broke over 30 years of silence.I have urged the Governments of both Bosnia & Cambodia to deliver justice for these victims In Cambodia,women organized an informal hearing 2 spotlight #sexualviolence during the Khmer Rouge era left unaddressed by formal mechanisms From the Congo to Cambodia, from Bosnia to Liberia, these crimes have been neglected at the peace table and stricken from the public record. The report is also a historical record. This is critical, as the history of rape has been a history of denial. The acts of sexual torture& terror recorded here are not inevitable byproducts of war, but crimes committed by combatants&their commanders. These reports are also vehicles for putting names to some of history’s complex horrors. These reports do not just highlight horror stories; they are a place to feature the stories of actions that have made a difference. Today's Annual Report provides striking examples of #sexualviolence as a threat to security. No one can read this report and remain unmoved. In contemporary wars,it has become more dangerous to be a woman fetching water or collecting firewood,than to be a fighter on the frontline. Yet the #unsecuritycouncil has kept pace with the changing dynamics of conflict A decade ago, my mandate to be present in the #securitycouncil,addressing this subject, would have seemed improbable. In short: the #unsecuritycouncil has ushered in an ideological shift. And when it takes notice, so do others. The #unsecuritycouncil has led the way in recognizing that rape can acquire a strategic twist as a tactic of war #conflictrelatedsexualviolence is not specific to one country: it is a global risk. The terror of unarmed women facing armed men is age-old Earlier this month,a Guinean panel of judges charged LtCol.  Moussa Tiegboro Camara for his alleged role in the atrocities. This is progress As world public opinion applauded the commitments of the #unsecuritycouncil, intern'tl headlines told of soldiers raping in broad daylight The demonstration condemned mass rape by security forces in the small West African nation of Guinea On 30 September 2009, two dramatically different events took place: the adoption of Resolution 1888 & a demonstration, just outside the UN Reporting to the #securitycouncil right now on the UN's Secretary-General's Annual Report on #sexualviolenceinconflict This is the first report to name&shame perpetrators -- see my HuffingtonPost piece on #sexualviolence in conflict: http://t.co/aSVueYI0 Today is an important day -- briefing the #securitycouncil, whose members will decide our future mandate. Starts at 10:30am NY time. @niklassvensson: Kontakta Mattias Sundholm på sundholm@un.org Successful project from Physicians for Human Rights: 1st joint regional training in DRC for docs, nurses, police & judges on #sexualviolence It is crucial that all victims, witnesses&their families are afforded full protection&that no effort is spared to ensure their safety The legacy of the mass rape is far from over. There remains an urgent need 2 assist the survivors&bring the remaining perpetrators 2 justice These charges in Guinea signal that no official is above the law, and no citizen is below it We agreed on a Joint Communiqué, and the recent charges are a welcome step in the right direction Last November, I visited Guinea to meet with rape survivors, representatives of victims associations, and Government officials. Justice in Guinea has been delayed, but this signals that it cannot be denied. Lt. Col. Camara is the highest-ranking official yet to be charged for his role in the massacre in Guinea I welcome that a Guinean court has filed charges against Lt Col Camara for the atrocities incl mass rapes in Conakry on 28 September 2009 Egyptian parties want to end state of emergency but refuse to end discrimination against women = no real peace Positive that Libyan judicial police have taken over jails following #humanrights complaints. Important to remember #sexualviolence too Afghan women worry about 2014 when internationals will leave Afghanistan At int'l conf on #WomenPeace&Security in Afghanistan, where I met Afghan women who experience increased violence against them The Daily Beast today: 'Women World Leaders Share Lessons Learned as Council Marks 15th Year' @ http://t.co/zqshd0lc Pres. Tarja Halonen of Finland: 'You cannot choose your gender, but you can choose to be a feminist' http://t.co/DzS3nHUz Meeting of the Council of Women World Leaders in Washington, DC http://t.co/KzlVCmMP #sexualviolence is everyone's business -- from gender experts to Generals; from local police to regional and international peacekeepers Formal accountability,recognit.&redress can make the difference betw rape being a traumatic event,& an event that permanently destroys lives Their freedom of movement,health&human dignity is denied.By punishing the perpetrators,we can lift the burden of blame fr victims We have seen that rape can be a life sentence for the survivors. They are sanctioned socially and economically. Excerpt fr speech given at the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (#ICGLR) Summit's Special Session on #sexualviolence 2day: Pillay: On #HumanRightsDay 2011,I urge everyone everywhere to join in my campaign to help more people know, demand&defend their human rights Pillay: Governments no longer hold the ability to monopolize the dissemination of info. Instead we are seeing real lives in real struggle Pillay: In 2011, the very idea of 'power' shifted -- wielded increasingly by ordinary men and women standing up to demand their rights -- A year when a single word struck a chord which swiftly rose to a crescendo. That word, that quest, was for 'dignity.'" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay: "2011 has been an extraordinary year for human rights. Manjoo: Women are entitled to contribute to societal change and transformation, free from threats and violence Manjoo: Women have stood together with men in the streets, at the frontline of the struggle for a better future & have also provided support UN Special Rapporteur on #ViolenceagainstWomen Manjoo: Moments of political transition unique opportunity to ensure women's participation ICC Prosecutor: "Electoral violence is no longer a ticket to power, I assure you. It is a ticket to The Hague" Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court: “Those responsible for violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo must face justice" We continue to monitor the situation in terms of #sexualviolence in the DRC&other areas of concern & stand in solidarity with the survivors. The worldwide travel ban and assets freeze will limit the room for maneuver for Sheka and others responsible for human rights violations. The sanctions decision regarding Sheka sends a clear and resounding signal that impunity for crimes of #sexualviolence will not be tolerated Sheka is the political leader of a Mai Mai militia group who in 2010 planned and ordered mass rapes in Walikale, in eastern Congo (DRC). I welcome the UN Security Council’s announcement that Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka is now subject to Security Council sanctions. Additional resources are also required to strengthen the capacity of the judicial system in order to address the issue of #sexualviolence Much more needs to be done to support survivors of #sexualviolence in CDI in terms of access to justice,services& reintegration into society In light of the upcoming elections in this country, I call on all in positions of influence to speak up against the use of #sexualviolence I encourage the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to translate its promise to fight impunity for crimes of #sexualviolence into concrete action During my visit in CDI, I have met with survivors of #sexualviolence, UN leadership, Government + civil society representatives & caregivers I'm currently in Côte d’Ivoire to raise awareness of the risk of #sexualviolence being used as a tool of pol. intimidation during elections The terrible events that took place in Walikale last summer created a global outcry. Impunity is not an option. I call upon Congolese law enforcement agencies to enforce the arrest warrant for militia commander Sheka and bring him 2 justice immediately He's already indicted 4 crimes perpetrated against citizens of Walikale;now asking 4 their votes is nothing but a grave insult&unacceptable It has been brought to my attention that militia commander Sheka,indicted 4 crimes of #sexualviolence has recently been campaigning in DRC Let us all contribute in ways large and small to building a safer world for girls and women. Women are leaders and activists, but can only reach their full potential when they feel safe. UN Security Council Resolutions 1325, 1820, 1888 and 1960 are key achievements, but we cannot afford to grow complacent. Much more is needed Political leaders throughout the world, spearheaded by the UN Security Council, have expressed their commitment to prevent #sexualviolence Together we must break down the walls of silence and shame surrounding #sexualviolence For too long, crimes of #sexualviolence have been perceived as inevitable, unspeakable and a lesser crime. These survivors, mainly women and girls, have lived through unspeakable horrors at the hands of armed groups On this day, I ask people to stand in solidarity with the survivors of #sexualviolence in conflict throughout the world Today we celebrate the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women « Vous êtes leur espoir, elles viendront vers vous car elles ont confiance en vous. Faites de leur sécurité votre priorité. » «Les femmes ont subi les pires atrocités durant la crise postélectorale et elles ont peur que cela ne se répète au cours des législatives.» « Vous devez trouver les moyens pour le faire de la façon la plus efficace.» (en Côte d’Ivoire) Message aux casques bleus à Bouaké aujourd'hui:« Vous avez le mandat de protéger les civils, les femmes et les jeunes filles en particulier» J'ai rencontré des ONGs locales et des victimes des crimes graves qui ont été commis au stade à Conakry le 28 septembre 2009 Le Ministre de la Justice a exprimé la disponibilité du Gouvernement de lutter contre l’impunité et de promouvoir les droits des victimes Je me félicite du Communiqué conjoint du Gouvernement de Guinée et l’ONU sur la lutte contre les violences sexuelles Justice in Guinea has been delayed,but cannot be denied.The atrocities that occurred 28 Sep 09 must never be forgotten and never be repeated I welcome the Joint Communiqué between the Government of Guinea & the UN, clearly stating the Government's commitment to fight impunity We came to Guinea-Conakry to listen, to gain a deeper understanding of the situation, and to agree on an agenda for follow-up. I visited Guinea to meet with survivors, representatives of victims associations, and Government officials. The  legacy of 28 Sep '09 is far from over. There remains today an urgent need to assist the survivors and bring the perpetrators to justice Two years ago, the atrocities including mass rapes perpetrated against peaceful protesters in Guinea by security forces shocked the world I call on all people in positions of influence in Sierra Leone to speak up against using #sexualviolence as a tool of political intimidation Preventing #sexualviolence is particularly important as Sierra Leone is drawing closer to elections More needs to be done to support these survivors, both in terms of access to justice, services and to help them reintegrate into society Only a country thoroughly addressing the wrongdoings of the past can build a solid foundation for a successful and sustainable future But we must not ignore the past or forget the survivors of sexual violence in Sierra Leone. I understand that the country as a whole, incl. the Government of Sierra Leone, wants to look to the future, instead of dwelling on the past -- to gather a better understanding of how sexual violence during the war has influenced the society after the guns have fallen silent As part of an official visit to West Africa, I am currently in Sierra Leone -- a post-conflict country Swedish speaker? Watch me on TV4 Nyhetsmorgon this morning at 7:15am. UNTV production 'Bosnia: Healing the Wounds of War' asks whether the wounds of war can ever really be healed. Watch it@ http://t.co/ceudcFon @tesse_jaramillo 1000 tack! Det är en stor ära. Ser fram emot festligheterna på lördag! I remind all parties that rape can be a crime against humanity, no less grave than other crimes,& that perpetrators will be held accountable authorities to investigate as a matter of urgency these alleged incidents with a view to holding the perpetrators accountable for these acts In line with the joint communiqué issued by the Government of Angola and the UN in March 2011, I call upon Angolan and Congolese authorities The most recent incidents would have occurred in the village of Tshiambi in the Republic of Angola between 4 and 7 October 2011 as they are expelled from Angola. These allegations include rape, beatings, looting and torture by security forces of the Governm. of Angola I am deeply concerned about allegations that Congolese migrants continue to be the targets of serious human rights violations It is crucial that these & other witnesses are afforded full legal protection,and I trust that relevant authorities will ensure their safety This case is another testament to the resilience of BiH women who have joined forces in their quest for justice, within&beyond the courtroom Ultimately, their actions contribute to strengthening the rule of law in Bosnia as a whole. I want to commend the courageous witnesses who have stepped forward to testify in this case. While this verdict is a positive step, the pace of justice for #sexualviolence survivors in BiH has been painfully slow Yet 16 years after the end of the war, there is still no justice for the majority of the approx. 50,000 women survivors of #sexualviolence Bosnia: I welcome the conviction today of Sasa Baricanin, who has finally been brought to justice for acts of #rape, murder and enslavement.

I warmly congratulate the three laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize today - President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee, & Tawakkul Karman Justice has been delayed, but it cannot be denied. We continue to monitor the situation in Guinea-Conakry and elsewhere for #sexualviolence Known abusers must also be removed from positions of power. Prosecute all those suspected of abuse in accordance with int'l standards. I call upon the political authorities to break the vicious cycle of violence & impunity. Support the work of the independent panel of judges Dozens of public rapes & gang-rapes of women in broad daylight dramatically showed that sexual violence is not only a weapon in times of war Two years ago, the massacre of peaceful protesters by security forces in Guinea-Conakry shocked the world. Women were particularly targeted. Wangari Maathai - environmentalist & a fighter for women's rights - will be deeply missed, in Kenya & worldwide. Plant a tree in her honour! Beyond responding to sexual violence as a health issue, we have begun to identify ways to prevent it as a security threat. We must recognize these realities, and be prepared to meet head-on the challenge of ending sexual violence -- against women, men or children We have increasingly witnessed sexual violence in the context of political strife, fraught elections and post-election crises. The changing nature of armed conflict has placed civilians on the frontlines like never before in history. see so many Member States represented at such a high-level, as well as 17 Non-Governmental Organisations, at the summit today. taking stock of where the UN system and Member States are two years after UN Security Council resolution 1888 was adopted.

I am very concerned about these judgments, as they infringe on the freedom of speech&stifle #sexualviolence survivors&those who support them A female colleague also working at Al-Jarida, Ms. Fatima #Ghazali, was given the same sentence earlier this month.

Utmaningarna landet står inför är enorma Swedish speaker? Please see my latest blog post @ http://t.co/4YUiHAo Today's Bushani report indirectly confirms the importance of security sector reform in the DRC in general and army reform more specifically. An army turning on its own people cannot be left unchecked or unpunished. Primary responsibility rests with the Congolese authorities. Most worrying in the follow-up is the limited cooperation between the FARDC and the military justice, impeding efforts to fight impunity It also provides the DRC government, MONUSCO and humanitarian partners with recommendations on how to better protect civilians The report establishes what took place in the villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro in North Kivu 31 December 2010-1 January 2011 I welcome the report issued today by the UN's Joint Human Rights Office on the mass rapes and other human rights violations in eastern DRC Just attended reception welcoming South Sudan as the latest Member State to join the United Nations Receiving worrying reports on #sexualviolence among refugees in the Horn of Africa @ http://t.co/oDaKFww Two days until independence: 'Unique Chance for #southsudan to Herald Women's Rights,' op-ed in the Huffington Post @ http://t.co/30Xw3wg It's three years since UN Security Council resolution 1820 was adopted.

Given the significant security challenges that remain in the country, it is crucial that the UN has a continued peacek. presence in the DRC mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) I welcome the adoption today by the UN Security Council of resolution 1991 (2011), extending the mandate of MONUSCO, the UN’s peacekeeping Also UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, U.S. Deputy Permanent Representative Rosemary DiCarlo + Czech Ambassador Edita Hrda will attend 2nite Meeting with Dr. Mukwege now.

This apprehension sends a strong signal General Lopez Fuentes faces allegations of genocide,war crimes&crimes against humanity, incl military attacks on civilians + systematic rape I welcome the arrest of General Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes by Guatemalan authorities. He was Chief of Staff, Guatemalan armed forces, '82-83 Any member of the military who preys upon, rather than protects, the population will likewise face serious consequences. All military forces in the DRC be aware that a Colonel was sentenced early 2011 to 20 yrs for crimes of #sexualviolence by his subordinates Crimes of this caliber are no accident–they occur pursuant 2 orders or lax command&control. Commanders&perpetrators must be held accountable For our part, the UN is in the process of verifying these incidents and identifying ways to support the survivors. Primary responsibility rests with the DRC authorities for investigating this incident, pursuing the perpetrators & bringing them to justice. This mass rape which occurred from 10 to 12 June demonstrates a continuing pattern of ill-discipline on the part of those who bear arms I condemn in the strongest possible terms the mass rape of over 150 civilians, mainly women and girls, in the area of Minembwe, South Kivu Attending the ceremony for the appointment of Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General of the UN for a second term.

Tack och med vaenliga haelsningar SIPRI: "Links between resource questions&conflict can only be broken if consumer and producer states, industry&civil society, work together" by adopting laws regarding these conflict minerals. When will the EU and the rest of the world follow suit? This calls for cooperative int'l frameworks for natural resources, such as so-called conflict minerals. The U.S. has already taken the lead SIPRI's Yearbook findings are just out: They point to natural resources changing from a policy concern to a security concern For Swedish speakers -- listen to latest clip re: Mladic on Swedish National Radio at: http://sverigesradio.se/sida/play.aspx?ljud=3132368 Only by explicitly bringing these horrible deeds into the open can we help to break history’s greatest silence It is crucial that the terrible acts of sexual violence they both stand accused of are exposed in the legal process currently under way Munyagishari is charged with rape as a crime against humanity. This shows that the fight against impunity continues to yield results and in the indictment against Mladić, sexual abuse or sexual violence is mentioned five times I welcome this week’s news that Ratko Mladić and Bernard Munyagishari have been apprehended.

Reports suggest that it is not plausible to consider her case an isolated incident Although most of these reports of rape remain unconfirmed -- and even brutally silenced-- they have arrested the attention of the world Despite robust action by the international community to protect civilians in Libya we still hear reports of sexual violence The number of reported violations is therefore just the tip of the iceberg of actual incidents Most cases of sexual violence go under-reported, due to shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and lack of help and/or legal follow-up …inevitably makes the AJPH figures higher It’s important to know that the AJPH study covers ‘sexual violence’ including domestic and intimate partner violence, which I commend efforts such as this to help fill the gap in empirical research.
