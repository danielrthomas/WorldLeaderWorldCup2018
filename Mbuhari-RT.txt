I received a briefing from the Chief of Army Staff this afternoon. The Army recently established a new battalion in Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna State, in addition to other deployments in troubled parts of the country. Our commitment to the peace and security of Nigeria is total. https://t.co/PpSfHlMT3B I thank the Government and people of Benue and other affected States for their understanding and continued support, as we work to restore peace and security to all troubled areas. We are also engaging with State Governments and community leaders, to build trust and understanding and ensure that all grievances are identified and addressed. I have approved the sum of 10 Billion Naira for the rebuilding of affected communities, and tasked the Vice President to oversee the disbursement of the funds, to ensure that our goal of rehabilitation and rebuilding is achieved. We will ensure we secure their communities, and we will help them to return home to rebuild their lives and livelihoods, and get every child back to school. We are increasing security deployments in the North Central and North West, where there have been violent attacks on communities by bandits and criminals. In addition we are focusing on the humanitarian challenges; the welfare of all the displaced people now living in camps. The Federal government released over N1.2 trillion for capital projects in 2016 and N1.5 trillion in the 2017 budget, figures that are unprecedented in the history of our country. We accomplished a lot more with the much less that oil prices and a recession confronted us with. Nigeria’s future is very bright. The economy has taken a turn for the better,our foreign reserves are approaching twice what we inherited, investor confidence is high, the Naira is stable. And just today the announcement that inflation has declined for the 15th consecutive month. We are doing more with less, in everything. From our progress in Agriculture, to the modernization of Nigeria’s rail networks, to our Social Investment, and other initiatives; we will make positive impact across every part of Nigeria, create jobs, and grow &amp; diversify the economy Among other projects, I flagged-off rehabilitation and expansion works on the 6,000-hectare Hadejia Valley Irrigation project. When completed it will serve more than 25,000 farmers. The World Bank is assisting us on the project, and we’re grateful for their support. https://t.co/6Lzk6ghaZl I spent the last two days in Jigawa State, seeing proof that Nigeria’s agricultural revolution is alive and well and on course. I have no doubt that we will deliver on our vision for a country that grows what it eats and produces what it consumes. The APC takes internal democracy seriously, and the success of the Ekiti Primary, with more than 30 aspirants, further validates our party’s democratic credentials. Let me assure that we will continue to work hard to lead Nigeria to the next level of its development journey. I would also like to commend all the participants in the keenly-contested Primary. I would like them to uphold the values and philosophy of the APC by joining hands to support Dr. Fayemi in the forthcoming elections. Congratulations to @kfayemi on winning the APC ticket to contest the July 14, 2018 governorship elections in Ekiti State. I have no doubt that Dr Fayemi’s track record as a reformist—with a passion for education, health and welfare—will stand him in good stead in the elections. I’m deeply saddened by the news of the passing of the Gen Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev (Dr) Musa Asake. This is a huge loss to the Christian community in Nigeria. I pray that God Almighty will grant his soul eternal rest, and comfort all who mourn. We will continue to engage to resolve issues and ensure that our common goal of leadership and service, for the good of the country, is not undermined or sidetracked in any way. This leadership is what Nigerians elected us to deliver, and we will not let you down. This afternoon, on my return from Daura, I met with the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives, at the State House. I briefed them on my recent trip to the US to meet with President Trump, and we also discussed the 2018 budget. https://t.co/kyGyjWyb8I The Presidency @NGRPresident has issued a statement to this effect. I look forward to my 2-day State Visit to Jigawa State on Monday and Tuesday next week, after my return. I will be traveling to the United Kingdom tomorrow, to see my doctor, at his request. Will be away for four days; back in Abuja on Saturday, May 12. I am not in politics for fun, frivolity or to amass wealth. I have always been driven by a deep sense of commitment to make a difference to the lives of our people. And my decision to seek a second term in office is informed by this passion to truly serve Nigeria and Nigerians. https://t.co/hfq6qjVuN8 The APC Ward Congresses today are a demonstration of our firm belief in the ideals of democracy, and the supremacy of the Party’s Constitution. Also a reminder that politics should be driven, not by selfish ambition, but by a desire to serve the people and improve their lives. Nigeria’s relationship with the United States is crucial to our success, via @Newsweek https://t.co/2gBOMJnSS1 #PMBinDC It was truly a pleasure and honour to visit Washington DC at the kind invitation of President Trump. The United States remains for us in Nigeria a valued friend and strategic partner, whose support and solidarity over the years has meant a great deal to us. https://t.co/miFjiXF3XF I had a very productive meeting with President Trump today at the White House. Key issues discussed: Security, Anti-Corruption, Trade, Human Rights, Humanitarian

During Working Lunch https://t.co/IApHI0H7v7

During Press Conference https://t.co/HQLbKjypUz https://t.co/19hGeyM9vj I want to assure the people of Benue, and all Nigerians, that we will ensure that the assailants are apprehended and brought to justice for this vile and sacrilegious act. This latest assault on innocent persons is particularly despicable. Violating a place of worship, killing priests and worshippers is not only vile, evil and satanic, it is clearly calculated to stoke up religious conflict and plunge our communities into endless bloodletting. I extend my sincere condolences to the Govt and people of Benue State, the Mbalom community, and especially the Bishop, priests &amp; members of the St Ignatius' Catholic Church, whose premises was the unfortunate venue of the heinous killings of worshippers &amp; two priests by gunmen. This week I met with a group of young Nigerians living in the UK. We had a long discussion about Nigeria: the opportunities wasted by a Party that failed to use the resources of the country for the good of its people, and how my administration is now correcting those failings. https://t.co/6DHP7G7jcR As long as I remain the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria the Chibok girls will NEVER be forgotten. Everything possible will be done to have them reunited with their families. Don't imagine for a moment that we have forgotten about our daughters or that we consider their freedom a lost cause. Not on my watch! We are however not relenting. We will continue to persist, and the parents should please not give up. Don't give up hope of seeing our daughters back home again. Don't lose faith in our ability to fulfill our promise of reuniting you with our daughters. We know that this is not the news parents want to hear after four years of waiting, but we want to be as honest as possible with you. Unfortunately, the negotiations between the government and Boko Haram suffered some unexpected setbacks, owing mainly to a lack of agreement among their abductors, whose internal differences have led to a divergence of voices regarding the outcome of the talks. My administration remains focused and determined to see that the remaining #ChibokGirls and Leah Sharibu return safely to their homes and their families. Rest assured that we are doing our very best to free the girls from their captors. I appeal to the parents to keep their hopes alive regarding the return of their daughters. The recent safe return of more than 100 of the #DapchiGirls, following the determined efforts of the Federal Government, should give all of us confidence that all hope is not lost. As we commemorate the 4th anniversary of the abduction of the #ChibokGirls tomorrow, April 14, let me again assure the parents and families that their daughters will never be forgotten or abandoned to their fate. I received a visit from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby and the Secretary General Worldwide of Anglican Communion, and former Archbishop of Kaduna, Josiah Idowu-Fearon. Our High Commissioner to the UK, Rtd Justice George Oguntade was also present. https://t.co/xYKMZCFN4I I am delighted to join our Christian brothers and sisters to commemorate this year’s Easter celebration. May it bring us renewed hope and confidence as a great nation. 

My 2018 Easter Message to the Nation: 

https://t.co/xFE9J6gPkh My heart goes out to Leah’s parents, who must watch other parents rejoice while their own daughter remains in captivity. It is my responsibility, under the Constitution of Nigeria, to protect all Nigerians—and I will always strive to do that. Leah will not be abandoned. It is disheartening that one of the girls, Leah Sharibu, remains in captivity. Let me assure that I am as committed to her freedom as I was to the girls’ freedom when all 110 of them were in captivity. We will do everything in our power to bring Leah back safely. I received the news of the return of our Dapchi daughters with great joy. And I look forward to receiving them at the State House. I thank everyone who was involved in the negotiations for their return. We are therefore widening and deepening domestic consultations on the CFTA, to ensure that all concerns are respectfully addressed. Any African Free trade agreement must Fairly and Equitably represent the interest of Nigeria, and indeed, her African brothers and sisters. As Africa’s largest economy and most populous country, we are committed to ensuring that all trade agreements we sign are beneficial to the long-term prosperity of the continent. Nigeria fully recognizes &amp; appreciates the efforts of the African Union Commission so far, regarding the implementation of a sustainable Continental Free Trade Agreement(CFTA) for Africa. We also acknowledge that our continental aspirations must complement our national interests. The Food Security Council will bring together the Federal Government, State Governors - who will be represented by 6 Governors from across party and regional lines (Kebbi, Lagos, Ebonyi, Delta, Taraba and Plateau), Security Agencies, and key players in our agriculture sector. Next week I will inaugurate a Food Security Council, which I will personally Chair, and which will work closely with the private sector to ensure alignment of all related policies, as well as bring greater efficiency to our farming, fisheries and livestock production. I would like to specially thank all who have played a part in the success we’re witnessing: Ministers, State Governors, the CBN - managers of our Anchor Borrowers Program, and very importantly the investors and millers. We must continue to collaborate for even greater success. The numbers so far have been impressive: investments of more than 300 billion Naira — a significant part of this invested during the recession; and largely in rural areas, building mills, creating jobs, empowering our rural areas. But there is still a lot more to be done. Last week in Abuja I met with stakeholders in the rice sector: investors, farmers, processors and dealers. I am extremely pleased by the impact they’re making in our rural economy; some of the most remote and hitherto forgotten parts of Nigeria. We have the fertile land, we have water, we have the manpower, to feed ourselves. We also have the political will. And we all know that when Nigerians are committed to executing a task, it gets done; when we all come together with the same vision, Nigeria must surely win. https://t.co/9exE8YOQid Our agriculture vision continues to be for a country that grows what it eats; one in which everyone—especially our youth—sees Agriculture as a financially viable sector; a country that supports farmers; and that promotes programs that will open up and invest in our rural areas. As I noted a few days ago at a Meeting with key players in Rice in Nigeria, since 2015, @ProfOsinbajo and I have commissioned several agricultural projects and programs, across the country—From rice to wheat to cashew to animal feed to fertiliser, drinks processing and many more. https://t.co/N8e1JHEBSD I commissioned the Sunti Golden Sugar Estates in Niger State today. We’re grateful to all investors who continued to invest even during the recession, demonstrating great confidence in our policies. We will continue to support the private sector to create jobs and prosperity. https://t.co/nQ5C2kbBSX Once again I sympathize with the people of Benue State, and the families of all those who‘ve lost their lives in these attacks. The security agencies will continue to work to protect all Nigerians. And we will not allow anyone who takes the life of a Nigerian to evade justice. https://t.co/eqKp3YSJoa There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, with different cultures and beliefs. God has put us together for a reason, and we can live peacefully together. On our part as Government I assure that we will diligently fulfill our duty of security and law enforcement. I will not be President forever, Governor Ortom will not be Governor forever. Long after our service, farmers and herdsmen in Benue and elsewhere in Nigeria will still exist and will live and work side-by-side. It is our hope that this co-existence will always be a peaceful one. https://t.co/hbyH5aLf7c My message to the people of Benue today, during my visit: We are doing everything possible to end the recurring attacks by armed herdsmen in various parts of Nigeria. 
I also appealed to them to please give the security agencies a chance to deal with the situation decisively. https://t.co/8PNOI3XMgg Happy 61st Birthday, @ProfOsinbajo. Thank you for being a loyal and dependable partner on this journey. I join millions of your friends and well-wishers around the world to wish you many more years of service to God, to Nigeria, and to humanity. https://t.co/CNAXJ5Vpcr My Speech at the 61st Independence Anniversary of the Republic of Ghana, today in Accra. I echoed the words of Kwame Nkrumah: “Those who would judge us merely by the heights we have achieved would do well to remember the depths from which we started.”
https://t.co/BVnPBtZ7sg https://t.co/uSFrMMNHuR In addition to law enforcement, we are also working with vulnerable local communities and their leaders. My message in Jalingo yesterday was that the Federal Government will support traditional institutions to fulfill their important roles as agents of peace and security. Our security agencies have made progress in terms of arrests in many of the areas that have witnessed these regrettable acts of violence. We have increased deployment of personnel and resources, and the fight against illegal and unauthorized weapons has been stepped up. I will be visiting Benue, Yobe, Zamfara and Rivers as well. All have witnessed unimaginable acts of violence since this year. I deeply sympathize with all who’ve lost family and loved ones. We are taking this issue very seriously, through law enforcement and peacebuilding. Yesterday in Jalingo, Taraba State, I met with traditional rulers, community leaders, and representatives of farmers &amp; herdsmen. It was also an opportunity to once again express my condolences to all those affected by violence, and to assure the State of my commitment to security https://t.co/fAHArnuIKe Boko Haram's recent cowardly attacks have only renewed the determination of our government to bring the insurgency to a decisive end, in the shortest possible time. I sympathize with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies working in Rann, Borno State. Unlike under previous Governments where trucks conveying fertiliser would miraculously disappear in transit, in 2017, none of the three thousand, three hundred and thirty three (3,333) trucks that participated in the PFI went missing.
https://t.co/yHzrPy1SeW Let me thank the Governor of Jigawa State &amp; Chair of the PFI Implementation Committee; members of the Fertiliser Producers &amp; Suppliers Association of Nigeria (FEPSAN), the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and the 3 banks that answered the invitation to participate. https://t.co/o40gcx8Xv5 15 months ago a Meeting I held with His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Morocco formally birthed the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative (PFI). Today in Abuja we reviewed the progress. I thank everyone who has worked tirelessly to make the programme a success https://t.co/yHzrPy1SeW https://t.co/ZL11edRMO1 They told me that they had given up all hope of ever coming back alive. I assured them that we will never give up on any of our citizens. 
I have asked the security agencies to ensure that every abducted person—including the Dapchi girls—is safely released. https://t.co/pqNEi7ENoS There were the University of Maiduguri lecturers, abducted while on service to their fatherland, and also the women abducted from a funeral procession. Today they are safely back home, and Nigeria rejoices with them and with their families. https://t.co/NKMkApDtyM I can't fully express the joy I felt I this afternoon, as I received our citizens recently released from Boko Haram captivity—fathers, mothers, sons, daughters. We will go to any length to ensure that no one is left behind in the hands of terrorists. Every Nigerian life matters! https://t.co/5bQJKlfZuI The military has since been deployed in response, and we are now sending more troops and surveillance aircraft to keep an eye on all movements in the entire territory on a 24-hour basis. The entire country stands as one with the families, and with the government and people of Yobe State. This is a national disaster. We are sorry that it happened; we share your pain. Let me assure that our gallant armed forces will locate and safely return all the missing girls. I want the families of the girls yet unaccounted for at the Government Girls Technical College, Dapchi to know that no effort will be spared to ensure that all of them are returned safely, and the attackers arrested and made to face justice. I share the anguish of all the parents and guardians of the girls that remain unaccounted for. I would like to assure them that we are doing all in our power to ensure the safe return of all the girls. I have directed the Military and Police to mobilize immediately to ensure that all the missing girls of Government Girls Secondary School, Dapchi, are found. The Minister of Defence will also lead a Federal Government delegation to Yobe tomorrow, to ascertain the situation. The perpetrators of all of these senseless attacks on innocent and defenceless Nigerians, in all parts of the country, will be made to face the full wrath of the law. We must and will bring the spilling of innocent blood to an end. May the souls of the dead Rest In Peace. I have directed the Minister of Defence to proceed immediately to Zamfara State to undertake an on-the-spot assessment of the situation there. My deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the Birane Village massacre, and the Government and people of Zamfara. I salute the leadership and statesmanship of former President Jacob Zuma, and wish him the best in his future endeavours. @CyrilRamaphosa Congratulations also to the African National Congress (ANC), and the Government and people of South Africa, on the peaceful transfer of power that resulted in the election of President Ramaphosa. Congratulations to @CyrilRamaphosa on his election today as the President of the Republic of South Africa. I look forward to working with him, and to the continuing cooperation of the Governments of Africa’s two leading economies. Today in Kaduna I attended the induction of @NigAirForce's ‘TSAIGUMI’, Nigeria’s first indigenously-developed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). It is most gratifying that the Air Force has gone a step further than simply acquiring UAVs, to locally developing them. https://t.co/8pLJizXjV2 Part of our success story in the Northeast is that Boko Haram is finding it more difficult to recruit people. The Nigerian Army is intensifying its onslaught; I am confident that we will soon achieve our goal of dismembering the group and rendering it completely powerless. Let me also assure that all persons arrested so far, including those arrested for illegally possessing arms, will be duly prosecuted. I urge judicial officers to be alive to responsibilities in this regard, to enable the speedy dispensation of justice. Our law enforcement agencies must at all times stay ahead of bandits and criminals, wherever they are across the country, by efficiently gathering, sharing and acting on credible Intelligence. I am assuring that we will give them all the support needed to succeed. One of the resolutions from our Security Meeting today is that all our law enforcement agencies must take intelligence-gathering and sharing much more seriously. The Police and DSS especially have been charged to step up their efforts and capacity in this regard. https://t.co/5MtTgLfRZ3 Today I presided over a Meeting of the Security Council. We fully understand the seriousness &amp; urgency of Nigeria's security issues, and are determined to implement carefully considered solutions that will not only earn the confidence of Nigerians, but also stand the test of time https://t.co/KrQ4ffLV6x I am very pleased by this. I commend all those who made it possible, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, for facilitating the negotiations. I have asked the DSS and @HQNigerianArmy to intensify efforts to bring home our remaining Chibok Girls. https://t.co/CZUFWZxaEP I'm extending my best wishes to #TeamNigeria as they proudly step out in Nigerian colours at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Congratulations to Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere, Akuoma Omeoga  and Simidele Adeagbo, who are all making history for themselves and for Nigeria. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders—State Governments, local communities, farmers, pastoralists, civil society and others—and to support initiatives to ensure peace and stability in restive areas. Questions and false insinuations have also come up regarding the Ranching solution proposed by Federal the Government. Let me state very clearly that the policy— conceived after wide consultations with stakeholders—is not meant to colonize any part of the country. I would like Nigerians to look at what we have accomplished so far in the Northeast, when you compare what the condition was before we came in and what it is now. We are bringing that same determination and political will to all of Nigeria's other security challenges. At every step, I have tried to foresee these security problems, counting on my experience as a former military officer who commanded three out of the four divisions of the Nigerian army, in Lagos, Ibadan and Jos. We will surely make progress, and end the bloodshed. It is quite frankly dishonest and unfair to insinuate that I am sitting doing nothing, while these killings are going on. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have and will continue to act in line with my responsibility as President to ensure security of lives and property. The security agencies have standing instructions to arrest and prosecute any and all persons found with illegal arms. In addition, quite a number of arrests have been made so far, in relation to the killings, and all these persons will be duly prosecuted. The recent killings in Benue, Adamawa, Taraba, and Zamfara states are all regrettable, and saddening. But even more importantly, I am very much aware of all the issues at stake, and doing my best to ensure that justice is done and the security of lives and property guaranteed. Today I met with the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), led by Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama. It was a welcome opportunity for me to explain in detail what we're doing as a Government to bring permanent resolution to herdsmen-farmers conflicts &amp; violence across Nigeria. https://t.co/9duVmArpTq I have repeatedly emphasized my vision for a Nigeria that produces what it consumes. To attain that vision, it is vital that local companies get preference in planning, designing and executing Sci, Tech &amp; Eng. projects. The EO I signed today is an important step in that journey. https://t.co/ZLy1N8ASst By this Order, in accordance with the authority vested in me by the Constitution, all procuring authorities shall give preference to Nigerian companies and firms in the award of contracts, in line with the Public Procurement Act of 2007. https://t.co/miTgy0lhs0 I wrote to the President of the Senate, outlining the several actions we have taken in response to the killings in Benue State. Let me again assure all Nigerians of my commitment to ensuring that justice is done and that Nigerians are kept safe and secure—https://t.co/os3VO8afkc https://t.co/biezCcEqU1 Congratulations to the home-based Super Eagles on their CHAN semi-final victory over Sudan tonight. Millions of Nigerians are rejoicing with you tonight, and eagerly looking forward to the final on Sunday. We are proud of you! We must push ahead to speedily establish the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), which will make Africa more integrated, united &amp; prosperous. As one of the principal architects of the African Union, Nigeria will show leadership and direction in this regard—https://t.co/iqRnaMFE0o https://t.co/s9GLXvPShL On behalf of the Govt of Nigeria, and on my own behalf, I thank the @_AfricanUnion for entrusting me with the responsibility of serving as Champion of this year's theme: "Winning the fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation." https://t.co/VAmzHm9VOH https://t.co/j5lfCqxJ5I With former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Head of State Abdulsalami Abubakar at the AU Summit in Addis Ababa, today. #30thAUSummit https://t.co/ZiqqeRByuG We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when as a country we failed to fully utilize rising oil prices to develop our infrastructure. Our administration's pledge to you is that we will make every Naira count, for the development of Nigeria. #TheYearOfInfrastructure I want to assure Nigerians that every additional income that comes to the Federal Government in 2018, from the rising price of crude oil, will be deployed to infrastructure projects: roads, rail, and power, for the benefit of all our people. #TheYearOfInfrastructure Yesterday I chaired a National Security Council Meeting. We are stepping up our efforts to tackle the proliferation of small arms and light weapons across the country. The security agencies already have standing instructions to arrest and prosecute anyone found with illegal arms. https://t.co/ttmV2inDsY Pleased to welcome Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Chief Bisi Akande to the State House this afternoon. https://t.co/T6hZftbufT On the economy I'm pleased with the progress we're making, the stable Naira, falling inflation, rising external reserves, rising harvests, an improving business environment as demonstrated by our rise in the World Bank's Doing Business Index, and growing manufacturer confidence. Security will also continue to be a priority. We have increased the deployment of security forces, to halt the attacks by herdsmen on communities, and bring to an end the sorrow and hardships that vulnerable communities have had to endure. Our focus in 2018 is infrastructure: roads, our railway projects, power, and airport concessions. We will intensify our efforts, and you will see progress. In this regard we are very grateful for what the Chinese are doing to support us, in financial and technical ways. Today I received APC Leaders from the southeast. I thanked them for  consistently standing by me and supporting our administration. Even at the risk of abuse they stand firm and try to explain our vision. I'm very grateful for their efforts and sacrifices. I will never forget. https://t.co/ZJ23UsBXKd Today I welcomed the President of The Gambia, @BarrowPresident, to the Presidential Villa. I'm delighted that Nigeria was able to offer support during a very critical period. I look forward to continuing collaboration between our two countries. https://t.co/faNeF8qt2j I have just finished a meeting with stakeholders from Benue State. My message to them: I will fully keep the oath I swore to protect all Nigerians. The Police, Army and DSS are working hard to keep Benue safe, and to bring all the perpetrators of the killings to justice. https://t.co/oT7gQs9kSF Today we honour the memory of our veterans, who paid the supreme sacrifice to keep Nigeria secure, united and at peace. I salute their gallantry and selflessness. Their labour on our behalf will never be forgotten. #ArmedForcesRemembranceDay https://t.co/lA9olFwMXp Our security efforts in Benue State so far. Let me reassure all Nigerians that security of life and property continues to be top of our agenda, in line with our election pledge and promises: 

https://t.co/l5QE6P2K6K Let me specially thank @Michael_CXT, whose submission inspired the final design of my 2017 Season's Greetings Card. He won the open competition @NGRPresident organized to design the Card. I congratulate him, and wish him the best in his future endeavors. https://t.co/SNNlvyc7m3 I just met with the Governor of Benue State. I assured Governor Ortom of our total commitment to the security of lives &amp; property in Benue and elsewhere. We have deployed additional security resources to fish out the attackers, bring them to justice, and prevent further attacks. https://t.co/d4MPtfOpd1 Our Customs and Ports officials must now make the Kaduna Inland Dry Port work. They must not frustrate business, commercial and industrial enterprises with unnecessary bureaucracy and delays. Our 'ease of doing business' attitude must be visible; we must make this Port work. I congratulate the Kaduna State Govt, Ministry of Transportation, and Nigerian Shippers’ Council.
And let me specially commend the initiative of the Shippers’ Council, &amp; the Kaduna Govt for facilitating the establishment of the Port by providing access roads and other utilities. Today is a landmark day for our importers and exporters. The Kaduna Inland Dry Port is the first proper Inland Dry Port to be completed among the seven approved across the country. Six others — in Ibadan, Aba, Kano, Jos, Funtua and Maiduguri — are at various stages of completion. Today in Kaduna I'm pleased to commission 2 additional locomotives &amp; 10 additional Passenger coaches for the Abuja-Kaduna Rail service; and to commission the new Inland Container Depot. Nigeria's infrastructure is being steadily upgraded, &amp; our economy is set for jobs and growth. As I promised in my New Year's Day Address, we're stepping up our interventions not only to combat crime and violence nationwide, but also to ensure that culprits are swiftly and severely punished. My condolences to the Govt and people of Benue, and the families of the victims. One of our pledges to Nigerians is that we will ensure the safety and security of lives everywhere in the country.We will keep this promise. Let me assure that security agencies are working to arrest those behind the regrettable attack in Benue State, and prevent further attacks. I appeal to the communities affected not to embark on reprisal attacks, but allow the security agencies to carry out comprehensive investigations so that the culprits can be identified and properly punished. I received with dismay the reports of killings in Omoku, Rivers State and in Sango LGA of Kaduna State. This violence is unacceptable. Let me assure that security agencies are working to speedily bring the perpetrators to justice. May God comfort the families of the victims. Good morning. And I wish everyone a Happy New Year.
#PMBNewYearSpeech Finally let me again express my heartfelt thanks to all Nigerians who prayed for me during my illness last year. I feel deeply humbled by your prayers and good wishes and I am more determined than ever to serve you to the best of my ability. #PMBNewYearSpeech I am grateful to all the Governors and other Political &amp; Community leaders of the Niger Delta States for their part in bringing relative peace to the areas.
#PMBNewYearSpeech With respect to the Niger Delta, Government is still engaging responsible leadership of the Communities to help in identifying and addressing genuine grievances of the region. Our clean-up programme in collaboration with the @UN is making satisfactory progress. #PMBNewYearSpeech With regard to rampant cases of kidnappings, we are taking immediate short-term measures to combat this new evil creeping into our societies. Tighter police methods and swift and severe punishment for those proved to be engaged in kidnapping are on the way. #PMBNewYearSpeech Terrorism and urban crimes are world-wide phenomena and our security forces are continuously adapting their responses to changing threats.
#PMBNewYearSpeech On behalf of all Nigerians let me offer our thanks to the Armed forces, the Police, other para-military forces and traditional authorities who are working round the clock to ensure that you and I go about our normal business in reasonable safety. #PMBNewYearSpeech Our government remains determined to protect all Nigerians in line with our election pledge and promises. #PMBNewYearSpeech We have since beaten Boko Haram. Isolated attacks still occur, but even the best-policed countries cannot prevent determined criminals from committing terrible acts of terror as we have seen during the past years in Europe, Asia, Middle East, elsewhere in Africa and in America. Before I conclude my address I must reassure my fellow citizens that security of life and property is still top of our government’s agenda. #PMBNewYearSpeech We should draw encouragement from the series of bye-elections conducted by @inecnigeria last year which were generally violence-free and their outcomes adjudged to be free and fair.
#PMBNewYearSpeech Political discourse should be conducted with civility, decorum and in a constitutional manner. We all have a collective responsibility to strengthen our democracy and entrench the rule of law. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech In this respect the rest of Nigeria could learn from the South Western States who have successfully internalized religion, ethnicity and politics.
#PMBNewYearSpeech As the electioneering season approaches politicians must avoid exploiting ethnicity and religion by linking ethnicity with religion and religion with politics. Such must be avoided at all costs if we are to live in harmony.
#PMBNewYearSpeech I assure you that government is ever receptive to ideas which will improve governance and contribute to the country's peace and stability.
#PMBNewYearSpeech However, there is a strong case for a closer look at the cost of government and for the public services long used to extravagance, waste and corruption to change for the better. #PMBNewYearSpeech We must give a long period of trial and improvement before the system we have adopted is anywhere near fit for purpose.
#PMBNewYearSpeech We tried the Parliamentary system: we jettisoned it. Now there are shrill cries for a return to the Parliamentary structure. In older democracies these systems took centuries to evolve so we cannot expect a copied system to neatly fit our purposes. #PMBNewYearSpeech We Nigerians can be very impatient &amp; want to improve our conditions faster than may be possible considering our resources and capabilities. When all the aggregates of nationwide opinions are considered, my firm view is that our problems are more to do with process than structure. No human law or edifice is perfect. Whatever structure we develop must periodically be perfected according to changing circumstances and the country's socio-economic developments. #PMBNewYearSpeech In respect of political developments, I have kept a close watch on the on-going debate about "Restructuring". #PMBNewYearSpeech Great nations are built by enterprising people who turn their hands to anything that circumstances dictate.
#PMBNewYearSpeech By the same token, I am today appealing to enterprising Nigerians with ideas and unemployed graduates and other able-bodied and literate men and women with ideas to not just sit and wait for employment from the government or the Organized Private Sector. #PMBNewYearSpeech Rice imports will stop this year. Local rice, fresher and more nutritious, will be on our dishes from now on. #PMBNewYearSpeech Two years ago I appealed to people to go back to the land. I am highly gratified that agriculture has picked up, contributing to the government's effort to re-structure the economy. #PMBNewYearSpeech We have got to get used to discipline and direction in economic management. The days of business as usual are numbered. #PMBNewYearSpeech Diversification efforts have resulted in improved output particularly in agriculture and solid minerals sectors. The relative exchange rate stability has improved manufacturing sector performance.
#PMBNewYearSpeech The government is slowly stabilizing the economy. 
It was in order to change the steady and steep decline that we adopted the more sustainable policies and programmes captured in the Economic Recovery Plan. #PMBNewYearSpeech You will recall that it was not until last year that we got out of the economic recession into which the country had fallen as a consequence of past unsustainable economic policies which projected short-term illusory growth. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech These massive public works should spearhead the recovery and lead millions back to employment. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech This Administration is working with the privatised distribution Companies to overcome the continuing challenges of distribution.
#PMBNewYearSpeech TCN and the Niger Delta Holding Co have added 1,950MVA of 330 down to 132KV transformer capacity of 10 transmission stations &amp; 2,930MVA of 132 down to 33KV transformer capacity of 42 sub-stations including Ikot Ekpene, Aba, Alagbon, Ajah, Ejigbo, Funtua &amp; Zaria. #PMBNewYearSpeech As I mentioned earlier, the Transmission Company of Nigeria can now distribute all the 7,000MW that can be generated.  
#PMBNewYearSpeech ... with a financing commitment from the government of China.  Completion is targeted for 2023.
#PMBNewYearSpeech The Mambilla Hydroelectric Power Project is at last taking off. This project has been on the drawing Board for 40 years, but now the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the 3,050MW project has been agreed with a Chinese joint venture Company 
#PMBNewYearSpeech The transmission and other requirements to operate the 30MW Gurara Phase 1 Hydroelectric Plant, the 40MW Kashimbilla Hydroelectric Plant and the 215 MW Kaduna Gas/LPG/Diesel Power Plant will also be completed this year.
#PMBNewYearSpeech The Zungeru 700MW Hydroelectric Power Project, stalled by court cases is due for completion in 2019.  
#PMBNewYearSpeech Katsina Power Project is now being tested and producing 10MW of power from wind for the first time in Nigeria. It should be fully operational this year. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech Several moribund projects have been revived. Repairs of Afam Power Station added 110MW in 2017 and another 240MW will be added this year through a private investment partnership.
#PMBNewYearSpeech Consequently, generation has now reached 7,000MW. On December 8, 2017 the country achieved 5,155MW of power delivered to consumers, the highest level ever recorded. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech The Payment Assurance Guarantee Scheme which started in January 2017 has enabled the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader to raise so far N701 billion to assure Generation Companies of at least 80% payment for any power delivered to the national grid.
#PMBNewYearSpeech More Nigerians across the country are experiencing improved power supply to their homes and businesses. However, power remains a concern to this government because too many people still do not have regular and reliable supply. #PMBNewYearSpeech In addition, Government has approved work to start on the re-construction of Abuja – Kaduna – Zaria – Kano road which is in a state of disrepair. Work will soon start and is expected to be completed in 2019.

#PMBNewYearSpeech f.    Kaduna Eastern Bypass,

g.  Dualization of Kano – Maiduguri Road,

h.  Dualization of Abuja – Lokoja – Benin Road,

i.    Dualization of Suleja – Minna Road.

 #PMBNewYearSpeech The following major highways are to receive special attention:

a.  Oyo – Ogbomosho,

b.  Ofusu – Ore – Ajebandele – Shagamu,

c.  Yenagoa Road Junction – Kolo Otuoke – Bayelsa Palm,

d.  Enugu – Port Harcourt Dual Carriage Way,

e.  Onitsha – Enugu Expressway,

#PMBNewYearSpeech Government is undertaking repairs and maintenance of 44 roads within the six geo-political zones. 

Twenty-five major highways will be funded under the N100b SUKUK facility. Each geo-political zone will benefit by an equal amount of N16.67b. 

#PMBNewYearSpeech The Management of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has been reconstituted and has been charged with a 12-week rapid intervention in road repairs to cover all the geo-political zones. #PMBNewYearSpeech 12 railway stations around the capital over a 45.2km route will serve as a catalyst and a pull factor to the economy of the area. The Light Rail System will reduce traffic congestion and carbon emission in line with the Administration’s policy on climate change. #PMBNewYearSpeech This train service will stimulate economic activities in the Federal Capital and provide residents with an efficient and safe transportation system. 
#PMBNewYearSpeech With respect to the Abuja Light Rail, progress has reached 98% completion, as at 64% completion when we assumed office. Only test runs remain before start of operations.
#PMBNewYearSpeech In the next few years, all these Nigerian cities will be linked by functional modern rail systems, giving enormous boost to the social and economic life of our people. #PMBNewYearSpeech Secondly, the Lagos to Calabar "Coastal Rail", through Ore, Benin, Agbor, Asaba, Onitsha, Sapele, Ughelli, Warri, Yenagoa, Otuoke, Port Harcourt, Aba, Uyo and Calabar.  
#PMBNewYearSpeech Negotiations are also advanced for the construction of other railway lines, firstly from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic passing through Kazaure, Daura, Katsina, Jibiato Maradi.
#PMBNewYearSpeech The Abuja to Itakpe line will go through Baro and terminate in Warri, with construction of a new seaport at Warri. #PMBNewYearSpeech At the same time I have approved and negotiations will be concluded in the first part of this year for the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri line covering Aba, Owerri, Umuahia, Enugu, Awka, Abakaliki, Makurdi, Lafia, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Yola and Damaturu. #PMBNewYearSpeech The Abuja – Kaduna route will be boosted by additional rolling stock next Thursday and will be able to handle one million commuters annually. #PMBNewYearSpeech Construction of the Kano – Kaduna segment is expected to commence this year and reach Kaduna by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021 the two ends will be joined so that we will have standard gauge railway across the main North-South trading route. #PMBNewYearSpeech The line should reach Ibadan from Lagos by the end of this year and will carry two million passengers per year and five million tons of cargo will be transported every year giving a substantial boost to the country’s economy.
#PMBNewYearSpeech With regards to Railways, we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Already in construction stage is the Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge Railway.   
 #PMBNewYearSpeech .@FMPWH is one of the drivers of this Government’s commitment to renew and increase Nigeria’s stock of infrastructure in order to achieve global economic competitiveness as targeted under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. #PMBNewYearSpeech We are going to make significant in-roads in advancing road, rail and power projects across the country. #PMBNewYearSpeech My address to fellow Nigerians this morning is devoted mainly to informing you about the intense efforts this Administration is putting to address our country's huge infrastructural deficit.
#PMBNewYearSpeech We must change our way of doing things or we will stagnate and be left behind in the race to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity. #PMBNewYearSpeech Such unpatriotism will not divert the Administration from the course we have set ourselves. Our government's watch word and policy thrust is CHANGE. #PMBNewYearSpeech I am determined to get to the root of this collective blackmail of all Nigerians and ensure that whichever groups are behind this manipulated hardship will be prevented from doing so again.
#PMBNewYearSpeech The consequence was that not many could travel and the few who did had to pay exorbitant transport fares. This is unacceptable given that NNPC had taken measures to ensure availability at all depots. #PMBNewYearSpeech Instead of showing love, companionship and charity, some of our compatriots chose this period to inflict severe hardship on us all by creating unnecessary fuel scarcity across the country.
#PMBNewYearSpeech Unfortunately, I am saddened to acknowledge that for many this Christmas and New Year holidays have been anything but merry and happy. #PMBNewYearSpeech I join my fellow citizens this morning to welcome and celebrate the New Year 2018. This year promises to be pivotal in our quest for CHANGE. 
 #PMBNewYearSpeech Happy New Year to all Nigerians. You can read the text of my New Year's Address here: https://t.co/1RGhuHlayF I am deeply convinced that better days lie ahead for us as a nation as we make progress on all the major fronts where we have set our energies to surmount the challenges. 

And in this season of hope, let us remember to provide refuge and help to those less privileged than us. https://t.co/FUyHTM4DZH I wish all Nigerians Happy Christmas celebrations. As I noted yesterday, the fuel scarcity that has caused many of you to spend this period on fuel queues is deeply regretted. All relevant agencies of Government are working round-the-clock to bring relief to you. I have also directed the regulators to step up their surveillance and bring an end to hoarding and price inflation by marketers.

Let me also assure that the relevant agencies will continue to provide updates on the situation. I thank you all for your patience and understanding. I have the NNPC's assurance that the situation will improve significantly over the next few days, as new shipments and supplies are distributed across the country. The fuel scarcity being experienced nationwide is regrettable. I sympathize with all Nigerians,on having to endure needless fuel queues. I'm being regularly briefed, especially on the NNPC's interventions to ensure that there is enough petrol available during this period &amp; beyond The national leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) visited today. I assured them of our commitment to the Rule of Law and due process, and made it clear that we expect a corresponding duty on their part to ensure the highest forms of discipline among their members. https://t.co/TBRHE5XHjL Today I signed the Condolence Register for the late former Vice President, Alex Ekwueme. We lost a great man, a statesman totally committed to the unity of Nigeria. The story of Nigeria's democracy would be incomplete without him. May his soul Rest In Peace. https://t.co/trSDCkCg6P Happy 55th birthday to @bukolasaraki. I join members of the National Assembly, friends and family in celebrating a distinguished Nigerian who has made his mark on the political scene. May God grant him more years of good health, wisdom and fulfillment in the service of Nigeria. I'm spending a few days at home in Daura before I travel to France for the One Planet Summit. Today I paid a visit to my farm. I grow fruits &amp; vegetables,&amp; keep cattle. I hope this will inspire one more person to take up farming. My vision is for a country that grows what it eats https://t.co/gMZIpHOtYk Before I concluded my Visit to Kano State I commissioned two factories: the Gerawa Oil Mills Limited, and the Fullmark Rice Mills. Both are fully indigenous companies, and testament to the success of our efforts at creating an enabling environment for investment in Nigeria. As I've repeatedly said, the only way I can repay Nigeria and Nigerians for their faith in me, is to completely dedicate myself to serving you. I will not let you down. I will continue to belong to everybody and belong to nobody, as I promised in my Inauguration address. I'm grateful for the very enthusiastic welcome I've received in Kano. As I said at the dinner reception for me last night,I think it has also sent a clear message to the opposition. I'm deeply &amp; eternally grateful to God &amp; the people of Kano for the complete trust they have in me Regarding corruption,when I was a military HoS, we locked every suspect in Kirikiri prisons until they proved they were not guilty. Now things are different. The constitution guarantees that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.That is the constitution, &amp; we will abide by it! This morning I met with religious leaders in Kano. We discussed issues relating to law enforcement, the fight against corruption, and the growing problem of drug abuse in Nigeria, especially among our youth. We will go after those who sell and distribute these illicit substances. My condolences to the families of the victims of the bomb attacks in Biu yesterday. I'm confident that the Intelligence Fusion Center we're setting up in Maiduguri will help us stay ahead of Boko Haram's desperate attacks on soft targets. May the souls of the dead rest in peace. Today I held a Bilateral Meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan. We agreed that more than ever the world requires cooperation and information sharing to defeat terrorism and extremism. I also thanked the King for Jordan's consistent security support to Nigeria. #PMBinJordan https://t.co/6NH8mba7A5 Also met with Chancellor Merkel yesterday, in Abidjan. We discussed increased cooperation to check the illegal migration of Nigerians to Europe. We also discussed the progress of our war on terrorism, as well as investment opportunities in Nigeria for German companies. https://t.co/lQ9iNtPqxX I met with President Ouattara on the sidelines of the AU-EU Summit. An opportunity for frank talk about the situation in Togo. We must find a solution. The government and opposition must work to gain each other's trust. Instability in Togo will have serious regional consequences. https://t.co/4Ij89jFpnV We have also started bringing back home all Nigerians stranded in Libya and elsewhere. We will ensure they all return home safely and are rehabilitated. The situation in Libya, of people being sold into slavery, is appalling and unacceptable. We will do everything to protect our citizens wherever they might be. I shared with His Royal Majesty the strong relationship I maintained with his predecessor and father, who was a Federal Permanent Secretary in the 1970s. The late Oba Erediauwa I was a backbone of support for me when I was Federal Commissioner for Petroleum Resources. https://t.co/rMeQqhEkEg Today I received the Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II. I have great respect and admiration for the Eweka Dynasty of Benin Kingdom. From the colonial era till now they have consistently played a stabilizing role in the affairs of Nigeria. https://t.co/gs3FKFd7w5 Saddened by the very cruel and dastardly suicide bombing attack in a mosque in Mubi, earlier today. My condolences to the families of the victims, and the government and people of Adamawa State. May the souls of the dead rest in peace. I wish Governor Obiano a successful second term in office, and assure him that the Federal Government under my watch will continue to work with him for the peace, progress and development of Anambra State. @WillieMObiano @inecnigeria The peaceful conduct and outcome of the Anambra election is an important step in the right direction, as we continue our electoral reform efforts. I am determined to give Nigeria free and fair elections, no matter which way the results swing. I congratulate Governor @WillieMObiano on his re-election. Let me also commend the people of Anambra State, the candidates, @inecnigeria, security agencies and all other stakeholders, on the peaceful conduct of Saturday's election. Today in Abuja I declared open the 2017 All Nigeria Judges Conference. We will continue to respect the Constitutional rights of the Judiciary, and expect its full support and collaboration in our fight against Corruption. https://t.co/NM7ra8Pmyc On behalf of the Federal Executive Council, and all Nigerians, I wish former President @GEJonathan a happy 60th birthday, today. I pray that the Almighty God will continue to bless him with good health, wisdom and strength. https://t.co/3ugnm8U6ud My condolences go to his family, friends, the Government and people of Anambra State, Ndigbo, and to the entire nation. May God grant his family the fortitude to bear this loss. Dr. Ekwueme lived a worthy life, excelled in professional practice, in business, in politics, in philanthropy. He served Nigeria and humanity. We will miss his counsel and wisdom on national issues. May his soul rest in peace. I mourn the death of former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, a patriot and statesman. His life was marked by an unwavering commitment to the unity and progress of Nigeria; and his personal sacrifices helped lay the foundation for our democracy. I will continue to express my gratitude to all Nigerians for your kindness and support during my medical vacation. The only way I can repay you is to rededicate myself to working to protect your interests and to build the Nigeria of our dreams. #ANewNigeria #Change https://t.co/AiMh7hC18D Congratulations to our soaring Super Eagles, and to all Nigerians, on tonight's victory against Argentina. Let me specially commend Governor David Umahi for his vision and commitment to the development of Ebonyi State. We are united by our unwavering commitment towards ensuring that the lives of our people are made better by our service. https://t.co/WQeW6dFHo6 Let me make this clear: We will deliver on all our promises to you. I said it when I met with Southeast leaders last month in Abuja, in response to the issues they raised about the state of roads and infrastructure in the region. I'm saying it again: We will not let you down. The welcome also came with 2 Chieftaincy titles: Enyioma 1 of Ebonyi, which I am told means Trustworthy friend of Ebonyi; &amp; Ochioha Ndigbo, which means Leader of Igbo people. I am a strong believer in the unity of Nigeria. Our diversity should be a source of strength not weakness https://t.co/GJBJiH5tzg I thank the people of the Southeast for the enthusiastic welcome they've accorded me since I arrived this morning. From Enugu to Abakaliki, I have enjoyed a profuse display of warmth from everyone; political leaders, traditional leaders, citizens. I thank you all. https://t.co/yxNhRFFmIw I touched on the situation in Kaduna, where Gov @elrufai is trying to implement important reforms. It's a very serious situation when teachers cannot pass the exams they're supposed to administer to their students. It underscores the urgent need for comprehensive national reform. I just opened a Special Retreat of the Federal Executive Council on the challenges facing Nigeria's education sector. We've brought together Government officials, academic experts, civil society and development institutions for this all-important conversation. The CAN delegation raised concerns about the allegations of one-sidedness in federal appointments. I assured them that we will look at it. I have already instructed that a list of all heads of parastatals be submitted to me. We will ensure that we treat all Nigerians equitably. Following the meeting with Christian leaders, led by the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev Ayokunle, I met with a delegation of Muslim leaders, led by the Secretary General of Jama'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu. https://t.co/Q9RiVEimhT I just welcomed Christian leaders to the State House, for a meeting. At 2pm I will meet with Muslim leaders. Our diversity is one of the most important things about us as a nation, and we must do everything in our power to promote religious harmony and understanding. https://t.co/Yhi94eJnqs @NGRPresident Doing More With Less; Keeping the Promise of Change. @nsia_nigeria has seen inflows of $500m under the @MBuhari Administration 
#GovtAtWorkNG #MoreWithLess https://t.co/edg8NoHvaJ 15/ Our SWF did not receive new investment for 4 years of record high oil prices.
But despite low prices, we invested an additional US$500m. 14/ A new non-stop express Train service(1 hour 15min) between Abuja &amp; Kaduna will launch by December 2017,to complement existing services 13/ We've commenced extension of the Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail Line to connect Apapa &amp; Tin Can Port Complexes. Completion by Dec 2018 12/ We have approved a N701bn Payment Guarantee Scheme that will assure GenCos of up to 80% payment on invoices, &amp; restore sector confidence 11/ Since 2015 the TCN and NDPHC have invested and worked to expand Transmission capacity, so that today it can handle up to 7,000MW. 10/ We're introducing innovative financing to bridge infrastructure gaps. Like private sector road interventions in exchange for tax credits 9/ In addition we have also been adjudged one of the world's Top 10 Reformers by the standards of the World Bank Doing Business Index. 8/ Our target for this year's World Bank Doing Business Index was to move 20 places up. We moved 24. I commend VP @ProfOsinbajo and PEBEC. 7/ 2008 Nigeria was ranked 120th on World Bank's Doing Biz Index. By 2015 when we took office,we'd fallen to 169. In 2017 we're up 24 places 6/ In the 2016 Budget we invested 1.2 Trillion Naira in infrastructure. This is the highest ever in Nigeria's history. We will do even more. 5/ Our Social Investment Prog is feeding 4.5m Schoolchildren; employed 200,000 unemployed graduates; &amp; disbursed loans to 250,000 businesses 4/ We've kick-started the abandoned Itakpe-Ajaokuta-Warri Rail Line, unfinished for over 17 years. We expect to commission it by Sept 2018. 3/ The Bonny-Bodo Road, conceived decades ago and then abandoned, is now back on course, jointly funded by the FGN and Nigeria LNG Limited 2/ All of the 100 billion Naira we raised from our recent Sukuk financing is going into the development of 25 key roads across Nigeria. 1/ Abuja Metro Rail, only 50% completed as at 2015 when we took office—after 8 years. I'm proud to say we've now taken it to 98% completion. I will leave with you a few highlights from my speech today. Some of the evidence of the CHANGE we promised and continue to speak about. 2 points I'd like to reiterate:
1. The quickest solutions not always the best
2. Only Nigerian solutions can fix Nigeria's unique problems I will never tire of repeating this: a new era is here, the old Nigeria is surely disappearing. We must work together to sustain this CHANGE I thank you for your support and goodwill. As we emerge from a very difficult economic period, I'm confident that a new Nigeria beckons. Let me reassure all Nigerians of our determination to bring succour to you, to improve your lives, and deliver on our promises to you. I appeal to the National Assembly to swiftly consider &amp; pass the 2018 Appropriation Bill.Let us work together to strengthen our relationship I cannot but commend the patriotism &amp; collaboration of the National Assembly, in our collective effort to move Nigeria forward. I thank you. This afternoon I presented the 2018 Budget Proposal to a joint session of the National Assembly. https://t.co/MjnCOTauZ2 I'm deeply grieved to learn of the passing of Jide Tinubu. My deepest condolences to the Tinubu family on this sad and painful loss. I look forward to even greater achievements that will make a difference in the lives of all Nigerians. We will not let you down. I particularly commend PEBEC, chaired by Vice President @ProfOsinbajo, for this job well done in improving Nigeria's business environment. We also want foreign business visitors to obtain their visas on arrival; &amp; pass through our airports &amp; do their businesses with ease &amp; speed We want our people to be able to register their businesses speedily; access land &amp; credit &amp; obtain licenses without bureaucratic bottlenecks Our goal is to make it easy for people - Nigerians and foreigners alike - to invest and do business in Nigeria. I'm pleased by this progress I also congratulate all Stakeholders: the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC), the National Assembly, &amp; State Govts. I congratulate all Nigerians on this landmark achievement, which symbolizes the success of our Ease of Doing Business Reforms. The news that Nigeria moved 24 places up in the World Bank Doing Business rankings released today is most welcome. I'm very pleased by it. Our Change, the Change that the APC represents, is here to stay. We will stay united as a Party &amp; continue to work for the good of Nigeria. We will expand the Federal Executive Council to bring in more people and fresh ideas, for the ultimate benefit of the people of Nigeria. Regarding concerns about the representation of our supporters in the Federal Government, rest assured that this is also being looked into. I know that our supporters are also very eager for these Board appointments to be announced. By God's grace they will be announced soon. I said last year that we would shortly reconstitute the Boards of Parastatals. I regret the fact that we've not done so, for many reasons. Nevertheless, we will not rest on these achievements. There are still quite a number of challenges before us, and we are well aware of these Today,the World Bank released its latest Business Rankings report. We moved up 24 places,&amp; are one of the world's 10 most improved countries Internationally, Nigeria's prestige and credit-worthiness have gone up. We have regained our respect on the International stage. We've seen regular supply of petroleum products, a successful Presidential Fertilizer Initiative; &amp; TSA Implementation. This change is real. The APC is proud of our achievements in the last 2 years: the fight against Boko Haram, Agric Revolution, Improved Power, Peace in the Delta I must therefore thank all stakeholders, as well as a number of non-APC members who have consistently risen above petty partisan interests. I am aware that it is sometimes easier to manage failure than to manage success—especially the kind of big success the APC achieved in 2015. I have a long list of people I would like to thank: our Party leadership, the leadership of the National Assembly, our State Governors. Today I attended a Meeting of the National Executive Committee of our party, the All Progressives Congress. That said, the integration agenda is a welcome one, &amp; Nigeria will surely play a leading role—as long as all concerns are properly addressed Nigeria's recommendation is for the constitution of an expert committee to come up with an acceptable Roadmap, and timelines and budget. We must not lower the criteria or be in a hurry simply because we want to achieve a monetary union.  There is still a lot of work to be done Our view is that ECOWAS member states are not yet fully prepared for a monetary union.This has always been one of Nigeria's primary concerns Nigeria will caution against any position that pushes for a fast-track approach to monetary union, while neglecting pertinent issues. Regarding integration, it is important to take into consideration our varying economic conditions,as well as the lessons unfolding in the EU Today in Niamey I urged ECOWAS countries to proceed with caution regarding the push for a single regional currency by 2020. There is no one who doesn't see that there's been a considerable improvement of security in the N/East. But we will not let down our guard. I highlighted our success in moving Boko Haram out from their strongholds. Even their attacks on soft targets are becoming less frequent. Our discussion also touched on the fight against terrorism, where we have recorded significant progress. I told PM Abbasi that Pakistan should take full advantage of the new investment climate in Nigeria—product of our @EBESnigeria reforms. https://t.co/UpY2IqdLgX The performance of our countries in relation to trade and industrial cooperation has however been very disappointing. We need to do more. https://t.co/4Wbf7OkdEL My bilateral meeting with Pakistani PM Shahid Khakan Abbasi was fruitful. We have a long history of defence and military cooperation. https://t.co/HEriYDmo53 On behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, I congratulate @akin_adesina and the @AfDB_Group family on the #WorldFoodPrize honour. https://t.co/fJAmKhfhgp I appeal to the communities in the region to continue to strive for peace through dialogue, to achieve conflict resolution. Our New Vision for the Niger Delta will ensure that the people of the region benefit from and enjoy the wealth of their land. #NDNewVision This is yet another demonstration of our commitment to fully deliver our New Vision for the Niger Delta #NDNewVision Today I signed into law a bill establishing the University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun, Delta State. #NDNewVision https://t.co/yC5pihPAPZ When our children thrive, Nigeria thrives. We have a duty &amp; responsibility to deliver a better Nigeria to them,and we will not let them down https://t.co/sYmfCzgLBB You may know 3-year-old Maya Jammal, from her 'Baba Buhari' videos. Today it was my pleasure to meet her, Nicole Benson &amp; Aisha Aliyu Gebbi https://t.co/g4LLwqi4rt Let me also use this opportunity to express my satisfaction with the mutually beneficial cooperation between Nigeria and China. It is my firm belief that the CPC's 19th National Congress will usher in a new period of great accomplishment for the Party and for China. On behalf of the Govt &amp; people of Nigeria, I congratulate the Communist Party of China on the occasion of their 19th National Congress. We will work honestly and faithfully with every region of Nigeria, for the good of all. We will not let anyone down. I want the Southeast to rest assured that we will deliver all the critical infrastructure projects we promised. https://t.co/pgxG52qbwt I thank the delegation for articulating their demands, and I promise that my administration will continue to serve every part of Nigeria. https://t.co/J5xaM3zj2v Let me again assure that we are committed to the delivery of these infrastructure projects, with funding support from China. Projects like the 2nd Niger Bridge, East-West Road &amp; Coastal Rail project, which will positively impact the Southeast, are a priority for us https://t.co/RvaDYVBYkR This afternoon I welcomed a delegation of South East leaders, led by Dep Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, to a meeting at the State House. https://t.co/KQcVzxQC1y I pray that the Almighty God will comfort their families and friends. My deepest sympathies go to the Government and people of Kaduna State. I am deeply saddened by the news of the tragic drowning of students of Victory College, Kaduna, while on an excursion. Our party's Governorship candidate in Anambra State, Hon Tony Nwoye, paid me a visit today at the State House. https://t.co/CtH0LuQnIJ We are pleased with the progress so far in the implementation of our Agric vision for Nigeria, but we will not rest on our oars. https://t.co/FxuQEQ7dL0 Briefing today, from the Security Chiefs. The Armed Forces &amp; other security agencies have our full support towards ensuring peace &amp; security https://t.co/tMOLhQZGKC The perseverance, resilience, discipline, hard work and team-spirit which has propelled the Eagles to excel is worthy of emulation by all. The Federal Government is grateful to the Government of Akwa Ibom for the invaluable support it has been rendering to the Super Eagles. Tonight the Super Eagles gave us  a 57th Independence Anniversary gift. I join millions of Nigerians in rejoicing with the players and crew. Today I received Governor Obiano at the State House. The Federal &amp; State Govts will work together to ensure free &amp; fair elections next month https://t.co/VIhpl5Vua4 In Maiduguri I also visited our heroes wounded in the line of duty. Nigeria will eternally be grateful for their sacrifice. https://t.co/xdbw4wpcsF Today I visited the Headquarters of Operation Lafiya Dole in Maiduguri, Borno State, to spend time with our troops. https://t.co/Y08MFz687T The 1st of October is a day for celebration; for thanksgiving, reflection, re-dedication. God bless our dear Nigeria https://t.co/O7GoldXPQr https://t.co/btTy48rgFM She has won a well-deserved oppportunity to continue the strong leadership she has shown in domestic and International matters. I congratulate Chancellor Merkel on her electoral victory, and wish her a successful tenure ahead. @realDonaldTrump We discussed, among other things, America's ongoing support for Nigeria's fight against Terrorism and Corruption. This afternoon I joined a number of fellow African Heads of State at a Lunch hosted by President @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/kdcOwv8lHC Read the full text of my Statement today at the General Debate of the 72nd Session of the @UN General Assembly https://t.co/olk98BQonO https://t.co/wXB6AZOKlJ Nigeria is witnessing a revolution in Agriculture. Agriculture will create jobs for our young people, attract investment, &amp; grow our economy https://t.co/bfzvzi8Q5h The old, import-dependent Nigeria is disappearing and a new Nigeria is rising in which we grow what we eat and consume what we make. We will not relent in our efforts towards achieving agricultural self sufficiency. We will continue to welcome and support more investment. Our vision is for a Nigeria in which we grow what we eat. It is possible, &amp; we are on course to achieve it,with the private sector's support https://t.co/sWvKZhD5MI I commend the partnership between the Kaduna State Government and Olam, which has resulted in the factory complex I commissioned today. https://t.co/lBerfbFk7w Olam's investment in Poultry &amp; Animal Feed Mills in Kaduna &amp; Kwara is a strong vote of confidence in our economic diversification vision. https://t.co/4t5UDdXmLz Today Vice President @ProfOsinbajo and I welcomed the National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria to the State House. https://t.co/mJk1MugFOV May the Almighty God grant peace to the souls of the victims and comfort to the grieving families and community. Our law enforcement agencies are already working to apprehend the perpetrators of the Plateau killings and whoever their sponsors may be. We have a mandate and the determination to protect the lives and property of all citizens of Nigeria, wherever they reside. Plateau's communities have achieved a lot in terms of mediation and peacebuilding. We will not allow a return to the dark days of anarchy. It is unlawful and unacceptable for  anyone or group to take the law into their hands in the name of revenge or reprisals. I am saddened by the senseless killings that have taken place in Ancha village in Bassa Local Government, Plateau State. Let me again assure of the full support of the Fed Govt,to the Govt &amp; people of Benue State. Our agencies are on the ground,providing relief https://t.co/RQJceSRPJ3 The real change for Nigerians is an impact that is felt in their lives and their pockets. We are on the right path, and our work continues. https://t.co/UTgTks4QcK I'm glad we're starting to see the fruit of our work.But there's still a lot to be done;we will not rest until all Nigerians feel the impact https://t.co/t8OvDH479z Until coming out of recession translates into meaningful improvement in people's lives, our work cannot be said to be done. I am pleased by the news of our emergence from the recession, and looking forward to ensuring that the ordinary Nigerian feels the impact. Let's celebrate our Super Eagles, holding Cameroon to a draw in Yaoundé. The march to #Russia2018 continues, and they have all our support! https://t.co/HBaOdHRZ3z Let me also commend the Akwa Ibom State Government for its continued support, and for the provision of excellent hosting facilities. Football, like the NYSC, is a powerful unifying platform for us as a nation. Today's victory is for all Nigerians, at home &amp; in the Diaspora Congratulations, Super Eagles, on the impressive win. We are looking forward to you sustaining the momentum in the return leg. I join millions of football-loving Nigerians in applauding our Super Eagles for their skilful and entertaining display against Cameroon. #EidAlAdha https://t.co/8BuILbHlKk Our rich diversity as a nation is and will always be one of our greatest strengths. It must never be used as a tool of hatred and division. On a personal note, I recall that serving as an Army Officer in Lagos and Ibadan offered me very rich and fulfilling experiences. I remain convinced that the NYSC offers a great opportunity to learn a lot about the diversity that has made Nigeria a unique country. I am always pleased to see Corps members in Daura and other parts of Nigeria. From the postings, we get to learn more about other cultures. https://t.co/9KTuaTUe6e One of the highlights of my Eid-el-Kabir celebrations in Daura is the visit from NYSC members, after the prayers. https://t.co/6Bf8vuctGt I wish everyone happy Sallah celebrations. And may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Once again let me assure that this administration will not rest on its oars until we see the Nigeria of our dream. This Eid-El-Kabir celebration is an opportunity for us all to rededicate ourselves to the exemplary virtues  shown by Prophet Ibrahim. We must learn to see ourselves as brothers and sisters from the same heritage. And on our part as a Government, we will not let you down. On this occasion, I appeal to all to keep our prejudices aside and strengthen the bonds of friendship &amp; unity, to keep Nigeria together. Your prayers and support have energised me to re-dedicate myself and this administration to the task of building a great Nigeria. Let me again thank all Nigerians who prayed for my recovery and have continued to extend their goodwill and support since my return. I also congratulate our Muslim brothers and sisters who are currently in Saudi Arabia to participate in the rites of the Hajj. I felicitate with all Nigerians, particularly the Muslim faithful, on the celebration of this year’s Eid-El-Kabir. We will surmount this disaster, and, working with the State Govt, bring succour and relief to all affected persons and communities. My sympathies go to the Benue Govt &amp; people.I assure that the FG will make available ALL assistance needed by the BSG &amp; affected communities I will be monitoring and getting updates on the rollout of the Federal Government's humanitarian response to the Benue flooding disaster. I have directed @nemanigeria to immediately mobilize personnel and resources to the aid of the affected communities and persons. I have received with great concern reports of the flooding in Benue State, displacing, from early estimates, more than 100,000 people. The entire nation appreciates and celebrates your victory — the first in 12 years — and qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Spain. https://t.co/oZaMl5MmTQ I was pleased to receive our female National Basketball Team, D'Tigress, at the State House today. They have done so much to make us proud. https://t.co/62STjMSsnc I took the opportunity to remind the Ministers and Gov that our duty as Govt is to make a positive difference in the lives of all our people Reviving and growing the economy was one of the main issues on which the APC campaigned; we will not rest until we have fulfilled this. But we're also fully committed to taking advantage of the opportunities offered by these challenging economic times. We inherited the most challenging economic situation in our history, affecting virtually every household, and every business. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. Our Economic Recovery and Growth Plan is on course, as is the implementation of the 2017 Budget. Today I received a briefing on the Economy from the Ministers of Budget, Finance, and the Governor of the Central Bank https://t.co/SggLQaOWCP Congratulations to D’Tigress on the 2017 FIBA Women’s AfroBasket tournament win, &amp; qualifying for the 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup Indeed. I'm grateful for the way Vice President @ProfOsinbajo deployed his energy and intellect to take charge while I was away. https://t.co/ZnPtaEWcH6 I'm full of gratitude to the leaders of the PDP and APC for finding time from their busy schedules to visit me and welcome me back home. https://t.co/7MPJuKEf5b Today's Meeting with PDP &amp; APC was not a political gathering, but a symbol of our unity and an expression of the maturity of our democracy. https://t.co/1h4EQcju58 I have directed all relevant Government agencies and bodies to commence immediate implementation of these Agreements. Today's ratification of Agreements is an important step, in line with the delivery of our Anti-Corruption &amp; Economic Diversification Vision https://t.co/EORVGTGasf I've just signed Instruments of Ratification for a number of agreements covering AntiCorruption,Tax Admin &amp; Intellectual Property Protection https://t.co/kKQsXXQBQu In 2003, the late Chief Emeka Ojukwu visited me in Daura.

God  bless the Fed Republic of Nigeria https://t.co/zORIF5KFGN I received Vice President @ProfOsinbajo, SP @bukolasaraki, Speaker @YakubDogara at home this evening, ahead of my Trip tonight. https://t.co/2YXTuAdlgD My remarks this evening, when I received 82 of our daughters who have just regained their freedom from Boko Haram—https://t.co/1EJpqajzXW https://t.co/GvATCpJrZj I'd like to assure all Nigerians that there is no cause for worry. I appreciate your prayers &amp; kind wishes.May God continue to bless Nigeria Vice President @ProfOsinbajo will take charge in my absence. Government will continue to function smoothly and efficiently. I have sent the required letters regarding my trip to @NGRSenate and @HouseNGR, in line with Section 145(1) of the 1999 Constitution. Tonight I leave for London, to see my doctors. When I came back in March, I hinted that there might be a need to return soon,for a follow-up https://t.co/mfmVYSLfO4 We've always made it clear that we will do everything in our power to ensure the freedom &amp; safe return of our daughters,&amp; of all BH captives This evening I received 82 of our daughters, who have just regained their freedom after three years in Boko Haram captivity. https://t.co/fy6pEXAOZx .@nanonlineng May the soul of Chief Nzekwu rest in perfect peace. And may God Almighty grant his family the fortitude to bear his demise. .@nanonlineng Since its publication, 'Eze Goes To School' has been an important part of the lives of countless schoolchildren across Nigeria and beyond. I commiserate with the family of Chief Onuora Nzekwu, pioneer GM of @nanonlineng, and author of 'Eze Goes To School' and many other books. The prompt response of the Cross River State Govt is commendable. May God grant the souls of the dead eternal rest &amp; comfort their families. https://t.co/wcNkmwuilc VP @ProfOsinbajo will take charge of the investigations in both cases—PINE and NIA. His Committee will report back to me within 14 days. https://t.co/ktpOcGgDWP Special thanks to @flyethiopian for cooperating with us during this period, and for demonstrating intra-African cooperation in a real way. The Ministries of Transport and @FMPWHng, security agencies, @contactkdsg, Julius Berger and other stakeholders worked hard to deliver this. I expect that this model of inter-agency cooperation and efficiency has come to stay, and will be consistently replicated across the Govt. My gratitude goes to all who worked to ensure the successful completion of the runway work, &amp; reopening of Abuja Airport, ahead of schedule. Once again, I wish you all happy Easter celebrations. We will restore peace and stability across Nigeria, as the foundation for economic recovery, growth, and true prosperity. We will sustain the peace in the Niger Delta through engagements with stakeholders. We will fully implement our New Vision for the region. We will continue with the fight against terrorism and insurgency; we're determined as never before. We've worked hard &amp; will continue to work hard to improve security nationwide, sustain the fight against corruption &amp; revitalize the economy I enjoin all Nigerians to keep faith in the determination &amp; ability of this administration to change the Nigerian story for the good of all. As a people we must rediscover the values of peaceful co-existence, social justice, religious tolerance, dignity of labour, and patriotism. It is in our collective interest to live in peace, because without peace, no meaningful and sustainable development can take place. As we celebrate, I urge all Nigerians to live peacefully with one another, and do their utmost to make Nigeria a beautiful place to live in The message of Easter is filled with themes of love, faith, sacrifice, hope, victory; as espoused in the teachings and life of Jesus Christ Easter signifies the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, redemption over condemnation, and hope over despair. I congratulate our Christian brothers and sisters on the celebration of this year’s Easter. We will never ever give up, whether on rescuing all captives, or on completely vanquishing Boko Haram. That remains our promise to you. My special appreciation goes to the parents &amp; families, who have endured 3 years of agony. I feel your pain. Your children are my children. Regarding our Chibok girls, we must not lose hope. I trust God that soon, our collective efforts will be rewarded with their safe return. Let me use this opportunity to remind all that last December our troops overran Boko Haram's Headquarters in the Sambisa Forest. For this we have our gallant Intelligence &amp; Security forces to thank. We're also grateful to all International partners who've supported us. Today, BokoHaram has been degraded &amp; is no longer in a position to mount serious attacks,other than sporadic suicide attacks on soft targets At that time Boko Haram not only occupied the Northeast, but also unleashed fear and mayhem well beyond the region. It is easy to forget where Nigeria was when this administration began 2 years ago,and Boko Haram held no fewer than 14 LGAs in the Northeast It was to ensure the freedom of all BokoHaram captives &amp; recovery of lost territory that we gave the fight against terror our full attention We've reached out to the captors &amp; are negotiating to ensure the girls' safe release. We're willing to bend over backwards to achieve this. Let me also reiterate our absolute commitment to the freedom and safe return of the remaining Chibok girls, and all other abducted persons. I'm eternally grateful to God for the return of 24 of the girls, as well as of thousands of other Nigerians forcibly abducted by Boko Haram. Today commemorates an incident that we will never forget: the abduction, three years ago, of schoolgirls from Govt Secondary School, Chibok The Governors of Kaduna and Ogun States joined me for Juma'at Prayers at the State House this afternoon. https://t.co/EN0mjnDWcE .@cenbank @NGRSenate The nominees are as follows:

Nigeria stands with you at this sad and trying moment. Let me remind you of what I promised, in my New Year's Day (2017) Message to the nation. We remain committed to fulfilling it. https://t.co/jwwk0MlhUP I commiserate with the Govt &amp; people of Benue State. I assure that the incident will be investigated, &amp; the perpetrators brought to justice. I am saddened by the recent attack by gunmen on a market in Zaki Biam, Benue State, and which resulted in the loss of lives. At NEC I also apologized to the Govs for barring visits while I was away—I didn’t want Govt to move to London;I wanted it to remain in Abuja As I've said before,pursuing the interest of the Nigerian people is the only way to show my gratitude for the love &amp; support I've been shown It is most important that workers are able to feed their families, and pay rent and school fees. Extremely important. My promise to Nigerians is that I will not rest until I address all the issues that affect you. One of these basic things is salaries. I have directed the Finance Minister and CBN Governor to speedily release the 2nd tranche of the London-Paris Club refunds to the States.

Their actions are cowardly, and punishable before God and by our laws. My heartfelt condolences go to the University Community, the families of the victims, and the Govt and people of Borno State. I received the sad news of the terrorist attack on the University of Maiduguri this morning. The labour of our heroes past – and present – shall never be in vain. #ArmedForcesDay2017 https://t.co/76caT3VaLB High point of my day: speaking with troops in Sambisa Forest via video-call.

My administration will continue to be a committed partner. Congratulations to the eminently qualified Chief John Nwodo on his election as the President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo. Our vision is to revitalise 10,000 PHC facilities across Nigeria—in phases. In Phase 1 we will deliver 109; one in each Senatorial District. As part of the flag-off I commissioned the Kuchigoro Primary Health Care Centre, renovated as a model PHC, &amp; a demonstration of our vision. https://t.co/yRqMfGaKDV This morning in Abuja I flagged-off one of the cardinal programmes of our Administration – the Revitalization of Primary Health Care Centres Tomorrow in Abuja, in my role as ECOWAS-mandated Mediator, I will host a meeting of West African leaders on the situation in The Gambia. I'm hopeful that soon, Chibok community, Nigeria, and, indeed, the world, will welcome the remaining girls back home. And I salute our security agencies, whose efforts have resulted in the return of some of the girls, as well as thousands of other captives I also salute all who have been in the vanguard of the quest for the recovery of the girls, nationally and internationally. I salute the fortitude of the distraught parents. As a parent myself, I feel their pain. The tears never dry, the ache lingers in our hearts Our intelligence and security forces are unrelenting, and whatever it takes, we remain resolute in our quest to bring all our girls back. Let me again say, as I have pledged in the past, that we will not spare any effort to reunite the remaining girls with their families. In the last 9 months, 24 of the Chibok girls have been recovered/rescued, even as our gallant military has relentlessly subdued Boko Haram. In my Inauguration speech I made it clear that bringing back our daughters was a priority, as important as the defeat of Boko Haram. April 14, 2014 instantly became a watershed moment for the nation; and a rallying point for the world, in the fight against terrorism. 1,000 days ago, 276 of our daughters were taken away from us by Boko Haram terrorists. Presidential Inauguration Day in Ghana. Glad to be here to witness a peaceful transition of power. I wish @NAkufoAddo &amp; @JDMahama the best. https://t.co/4dinnLba8i I also again commend President @JDMahama for his maturity and statesmanship. Ghana has once again set a great example. Looking forward to the inauguration of President-elect @NAkufoAddo, tomorrow in Accra. Congratulations again to the people of Ghana! I am being regularly briefed on the situation. Let me again extend my deepest condolences to the victims of the violence. I am also aware that the Kaduna State Govt is carrying out peace-building efforts, to bring lasting resolution to the crisis. I have also since directed @nemanigeria to work with Kaduna's SEMA, to bring urgent aid to the victims of the violence. The DSS is also working with the military and Police to provide Intelligence, to help tackle the crisis. The Army &amp; Airforce are also in the region. @HQNigerianArmy is setting up two battalions while @NigAirForce is carrying out air surveillance The Inspector-General of @PoliceNG has visited the region to assess the situation, and oversee deployments of conventional &amp; mobile officers We have in the last one week taken important steps to end the killings and violence in Southern Kaduna, as I promised in my New Year Message https://t.co/65xajirbfW I wish you all a Happy New Year. May the Almighty God continue to bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I urge you to continue to support this administration in its effort to transform Nigeria for the good of all. I assure you again that the current pains are temporary and will ease when the economic seeds in gestation begin to bloom to fruition. I thank you for the public support for our administration’s efforts to transform Nigeria. It will be unthinkable on my part to allow the boat of the anti-corruption campaign — a key campaign promise — capsize mid-stream. Our war on corruption will not spare any person, or organ of government. Our determination to wrestle corruption to the ground remains unshaken, and will be guided by respect for the rule of law and due process. They are the engine of our economic recovery, and their needs underpin our Economic Recovery and Growth Plan for 2017. Farmers, SMEs, agro-allied businesses, dressmakers, entertainers, technology start-ups, will remain the true drivers of our economic future In pursuit of our administration’s philosophy, we will continue to appeal that we buy "Made In Nigeria" goods. Our economic recovery and growth plan in 2017 is anchored on optimizing the use of local content and empowering local businesses. I am optimistic that the CHANGE you voted for in 2015 will manifest more and be sustained in different sectors, in 2017 Our Agric revolution has begun. Farmers across Nigeria are experiencing bumper harvests; and states are getting into strategic partnerships. On our efforts to turn around the economy, fight corruption, and diversify from oil &amp; gas, I am encouraged that we are getting things right. I also acknowledge and assert that the law enforcement agencies must treat our Shia brethren humanely and according to the rule of law. Our brothers and sisters of the Shia Community, we equally urge you to embrace peace. You must accept the laws of the country you live in. All who have taken to violent disruptions of economic infrastructure should instead join hands with us to find peace and ensure development We will continue to pursue peace in the Niger Delta.Again I call on our dissatisfied brothers in the region to come to the negotiating table We have succeeded in harnessing our diversity for national development. We must continue to support one another and live together as one. We are courageous, hardworking, hospitable, steadfast and resilient people, even in the face of difficulties. 2017 provides an opportunity for us to build on those aspects of our national life that unite us. An African proverb says, "it is easy to break a broomstick but not a bunch”. Nigeria is a bunch and is more than equal to all troublemakers. Our defence and security forces are more than ever before ready to perform their constitutional role of protecting lives and property. In this New Year the lingering security issues in several states will be frontally addressed. We're aware of some mistakes &amp; wrongdoings in the handling of IDPs,and are taking measures to correct those mistakes and punish the culprits I urge state governments, privileged Nigerians, donor agencies and countries to redouble their contributions towards this goal. We will spare no effort in seeing to the resettlement and rehabilitation of the unfortunate victims of terrorism and insurgency. The joyful, voluntary return of thousands of IDPs to Damasak, Borno State on Christmas Day reassures us that more of such is imminent. On our own part we will ensure that misguided elements who take up arms against constituted authorities face the full weight of the law. The support of all Nigerians for the work of our security agencies is crucial in our bid to effectively secure our country. To support the war on terror I urge all Nigerians to watch out for strange figures in their communities, and report to security agencies. In 2016, 22 of our beloved Chibok girls were reunited with their families, giving us hope that those still in captivity will return safely. Following the successful capture of Sambisa Forest, we have entered a new phase in our battle against our common enemy, Boko Haram. Join me to again acknowledge the heroic efforts of our military and other security agencies on their remarkable successes against terrorism I'm happy to welcome you all to the beginning of a New Year. I have a New Year Message for all Nigerians—https://t.co/qpoLFlK1xn I remain optimistic that a peaceful resolution of the situation in The Gambia is possible before the January 19, 2017 Inauguration. The main task of the MST is to undertake the preparatory work that will lead to a high-level meeting between me &amp; all the stakeholders I've now asked Foreign Minister @GeoffreyOnyeama to work with President @JDMahama to lead a Mediation Support Team (MST) At the Dec 17 ECOWAS Summit in Abuja I was asked to lead the Mediation of the situation in The Gambia, assisted by President @JDMahama At the dinner, expressing gratitude, on behalf of the nation, to Maj-Gen Leo Irabor, Commander of the military operation against Boko Haram. https://t.co/o7qy5c3Jhf The Boko Haram flag recovered from Camp Zero. The COAS, Lt. Gen. Buratai handed it over last night, at the Guards Brigade Regimental Dinner. https://t.co/3Y4ifFRzvj Merry Christmas! I wish all travellers safe journeys and a memorable holiday as we celebrate with our family and friends. As we celebrate Christmas, let us reflect on the love of God aptly espoused in the teachings and lifestyle of Jesus Christ. I rejoice with all Nigerians, particularly our Christian brothers and sisters, on this year's celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. I'd like to appeal to all Nigerians to support the military by providing information that will expose terrorists hiding in our communities Congratulations to all our troops who contributed to this most commendable and momentous effort. May the Almighty continue to be with you. Yesterday, @HQNigerianArmy captured 'Camp Zero', Boko Haram's Sambisa Forest base. My message to our gallant troops—https://t.co/ds9uCZY7qD https://t.co/oxcsjD13Aa By next week about 33 State Governments would have received the first batch of the Debt Service Refunds I recently approved for payment. In all we've issued close to N400bn in conditional bailout packages to the States, as well as helped restructure &gt;N600bn of existing debt It was to tackle this issue that I approved, in 2015 and 2016, two sets of bailouts, as well as debt restructuring, for affected States This issue of salary and pension debts must be tackled by State Govts with the urgency which it deserves. It must not be allowed to linger I've asked State Govs to make outstanding salaries/pensions a priority as they receive the 1st installment of their Debt Service Refunds I remain optimistic that we will meet our target of self-sufficiency in rice by 2019. We will continue to make steady progress towards it. On the part of the Federal Government, we will continue to support these initiatives through favorable policies and incentives. I urge other State Govts to replicate the laudable example of LAKE Rice, not only in rice but also in other staple crops, and dairy products I commend Governors @AkinwunmiAmbode and Atiku Bagudu for fulfilling the MoU they signed in March 2016, to boost rice production https://t.co/Mu8eAHJvEi I'm proud of the successful agricultural partnership between Lagos and Kebbi States, which has produced LAKE (Lagos-Kebbi) Rice. https://t.co/9THA4mhMdF Pleased to welcome the President-elect of the Republic of Ghana, @NAkufoAddo, to the State House today. I look forward to working with him https://t.co/byPGzm0Za4 Happy 54th Birthday to Senate Pres @bukolasaraki, one of the most influential politicians of our time. I wish you many more prosperous years I will continue to work for the good of Nigeria, and ask you all to join hands with me, and my Govt,to build a nation we can all be proud of I thank everyone who wished me a happy birthday yesterday. I received and acknowledge all your messages and kind wishes. I wish @Pontifex a Happy 80th Birthday, today. It is my prayer that you will enjoy many more years of service to God and to humanity. I'm grateful to @AminaJMohammed for her service to Nigeria, and have no doubt that in her new assignment she will continue to make us proud. The incoming @UN Secretary-General António Guterres called this evening to inform me of the decision to appoint @AminaJMohammed I wholeheartedly endorse the choice of  of @AminaJMohammed as the next Deputy Secretary-General of the @UN. It is a great honour to Nigeria. The 3rd, a Warship, NNS UNITY, was built in China—product of our thriving diplomatic &amp; defence relations with the People's Republic of China I pledge the continued total support of my administration to the Nigerian Military. We will continue to fund and equip you to do your work. Nigerian Engineers at the @NigerianNavy Dockyard in Lagos &amp; Naval Shipyard in P/Harcourt built NNS KARADUWA &amp; Tugboat COMMANDER EDWIN UGWU Today in Lagos I commissioned three new Naval Ships. I'm pleased to note that two of those Ships were built locally by @NigerianNavy. The Minister of Budget and National Planning will provide a breakdown of the highlights of the 2017 Budget estimates I presented today. I must admit these negotiations took longer than expected, but I am optimistic that these projects will commence in 2017 for all to see. In 2016, we invested a lot of time on the paperwork for these rail projects—negotiating the most beneficial deal for Nigeria and Nigerians. #Budget2017 contains N213.14 billion as counterpart funding for the Lagos-Kano, Calabar-Lagos, Ajaokuta-Itakpe-Warri railway, and others Infrastructure will be one of our biggest continuing priorities in 2017: Roads, Rail and Power projects. I have instructed that the Export Expansion Grant be revived in the form of tax credits to companies. N20 billion has been voted for this. The new Development Bank of Nigeria will soon start operations with US$1.3 billion focused exclusively on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises #Budget2017 contains N50bn as the Fed Govt's Contribution for development/expansion of new/existing Export Processing &amp; Special Econ Zones The allocation for the Presidential Amnesty Programme has been increased to N65 billion in #Budget2017 #Budget2017 contains N500bn for the Social Investment Prog we launched in 2016: School Feeding, GEEP, @npower_ng, Cash Transfer &amp; others Social Investments will continue to be a priority. #Budget2017 contains N100 billion seed money for the new N1 trillion Family Homes Fund We've tasked the Efficiency Unit of the Min of Finance to cut certain overhead costs by 20%, to free resources to fund capital expenditure. One priority for us in 2017 is to bring about greater coherence between monetary, fiscal and trade policies. We'll continue our cost containment efforts. We've restricted travel costs, reduced sitting allowances,eliminated thousands of Ghost workers We will continue to confront the inherited issue of indebtedness to contractors &amp; other third parties, &amp; negotiate realistic payment plans Implementation of the public-private partnership models we have developed, to deliver critical Infrastructure in power, roads and rail This is what you should expect from us in 2017: We will resolve the liquidity issue in the power sector. On our part, Govt has made provisions in #Budget2017 to clear its outstanding debt. During 2016, we conducted a critical assessment of the power sector value chain, which is experiencing major funding issues. Nigerians will begin to see the tangible benefits of our Infrastructure modernization in 2017. Modernizing Nigeria's railway system is a priority in the 2017 Budget. In 2016, we made a lot of progress completing financing arrangements. In 2017, we will focus on the rapid development of infrastructure, especially rail, roads and power. I've established the Presidential Enabling Business Council, chaired by @ProfOsinbajo, w/ a mandate to make doing business in Nigeria easier Facilitation of business and commerce must be the major objective of government agencies. Government must not be the bottle-neck. I will be issuing some Executive Orders to ensure the facilitation and speeding up of government procurements and approvals. The new JV funding structure will positively impact Govt revenues, which will be allocated to Infrastructure, Agric, Mining &amp; Manufacturing From January 2017, the Federal Government will no longer make provision for Joint Venture (JV) cash-calls. We will also continue our ongoing reforms to enhance the efficiency of the management of our oil and gas resources. Our Econ Plan is the 'Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.' One of its cornerstones is promoting local content and empowering local businesses A pleasure to present #2017budget Proposals to a Joint Session of @nassnigeria,presided over by @bukolasaraki, today—https://t.co/5tnjbjZfUt The mediation continues. After our meeting with President Jammeh we met with President-Elect Adama Barrow. https://t.co/4l88pPvsx2 Our meeting with President Yahya Jammeh, at the State House https://t.co/y6EHp5RG1Z We will be asking President Jammeh to respect his country's Constitution, and to maintain the inviolability of the electoral process. We will meet with President Yahya Jammeh, and also with President-elect Adama Barrow. I am in The Gambia with other ECOWAS leaders to insist on the sanctity of the electoral process, and respect for the wishes of the people https://t.co/5nbCVMb8Pf As we celebrate and reflect, I wish all Nigerians a peaceful Eid-el-Maulud. This week, I will present #Budget2017 to the National Assembly—it is part of a Plan we're confident will get us out of these difficult times With collective dedication &amp; hard work, we will overcome our economic difficulties, and return Nigeria to the path of prosperity. We all share a vision of a better Nigeria, and we will all share in the responsibility of building the country of our dreams. Instead, these current challenges should remind us of why we need to stay together, fight together and succeed together, as a nation. The reality of the temporary challenges we're facing should not undermine our hope, or reverse our collective will to succeed, or divide us. On this occasion, I urge you not to lose faith in the ability of this administration to make a positive difference in your lives. I wish all Muslims a happy and memorable celebration. #Eidmiladunnabi Today we mark Eid-El-Maulud, the birth of Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him). Read my message to the nation—https://t.co/ej9GZAiElc Any tragedy that affects any part of Nigeria affects all of us. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people of Akwa Ibom. I pray that the souls of the deceased will rest in peace, and that the injured will experience quick recovery. I asked the Governor to convey to the people of Akwa Ibom the deep sorrow felt by me, and by the entire country, over this tragedy. This evening I spoke with Gov @MrUdomEmmanuel to commiserate with him on the tragic collapse of the Reigners Bible Church building in Uyo. I wish Ghana a smooth transition of power, and look forward to working with President @NAkufoAddo Africa's future rests on building strong democratic institutions, ensuring credible elections, and respect for the sanctity of the ballot. I particularly commend President @JDMahama for the great courage to call @NAkufoAddo and concede defeat. I also salute the statesmanship of President @JDMahama, who came into office at a trying period for Ghana, and worked for a better country. Congratulations to @NAkufoAddo on his historic win. The maturity and peaceful conduct of the election is a victory for all Ghanaians. The battle against terrorism is a joint effort involving all of us. Together, Nigerians can AND WILL defeat the evil that is Boko Haram. This latest attack is obviously an act of desperation, but the Nigerian military will neither be distracted, nor relent in its war on terror Putting an end to this senseless loss of innocent lives remains a top priority of our administration. My heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the twin bomb blasts in Madagali, Adamawa State, today. We remain committed to deepening democracy by building a legacy of respect for the people's wishes through free, fair &amp; credible elections I enjoin @inecnigeria to do all within its powers to give transparency and fairness to the electoral exercise in Rivers State. Elections should not be seen as do-or-die. Innocent blood should never be sacrificed on the altar of political contest for temporary power. I urge all political parties, candidates &amp; the people of Rivers to please ensure that tomorrow's polls take place without rigging &amp; violence The Management of the NYSC must continue to do all within its powers to protect the lives of those under its charge. In particular I have asked for an independent investigation into the actual circumstances behind the death in Kano of Miss Ifedolapo Oladepo Chinyerum Elechi, Ifedolapo Oladepo &amp; Monday Asuquo Ukeme, who passed on in Bayelsa,Kano &amp; Zamfara, died answering the call to serve Nigeria I'm saddened by the deaths of 3 NYSC members during the 2016 Batch 'B' Orientation. It is sad and unfortunate. May their souls rest in peace I have notified the National Assembly of my intention to present the 2017 Budget on Wednesday, December 14, 2016 #Budget2017 One highlight of foreign trips is the time I spend meeting the Nigerian diaspora. Today in Dakar I met a group based in Senegal &amp; C/d'Ivoire https://t.co/mjwzAPApfH I spoke with Gambian President-Elect Mr Adama Barrow on the phone this afternoon, to personally congratulate him on his victory. I'm pleased to welcome H.E. Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia, to the State House. Liberia continues to be a valued partner. https://t.co/Q4bB0e4AkQ She was a distinguished economist &amp; manager; a role model who broke the glass ceiling again &amp; again. May Almighty God grant her eternal rest I received with sadness the news of the death of Otunba Bola Kuforiji-Olubi.

His place in history is assured I received with sadness the news of the death of Fidel Castro. My deepest condolences to the Government and people of Cuba. I made it clear that I will remove ANY sign of padding in the 2017 budget document. It will NEVER happen again under my watch. Today, while receiving members of the Governance Support Group (GSG), I took the opportunity to comment again on the issue of budget padding Happy 70th birthday to @atiku. I'm glad to welcome him to the 70s Club, and wish him many more years of good health and service to Nigeria https://t.co/RjqOjgxCwB Today in Akure I presented our Governorship candidate, Rotimi Akeredolu, to the people of Ondo State, at our grand finale campaign rally https://t.co/wnJ8fEKQvu Let me assure all Nigerians that our Government will continue to work to fulfill our promises on Security, the Economy &amp; fighting Corruption I'm pleased that those who lost the Ondo primaries are still very much in the APC.

Evil will not triumph over good. I have also personally conveyed my condolences to the late Lt. Col Ali's father, Brigadier-Gen. Abu Ali (Rtd), and his widow, Samira. No words can do justice to the patriotism and remarkable courage of these soldiers, who laid down their lives for Nigeria. I received the news of the deaths with shock. Lt. Col.

I have asked Chief of Staff Abba Kyari to lead a delegation to represent me at the funeral of Lt Col Abu Ali &amp; other fallen heroes, tomorrow No man, woman, or child will be left at the mercy of Boko Haram.

We must cooperate to make Nigeria work for all of us I told the Leaders that they have more to do than anyone else to bring peace to the N/Delta,given the influence they have on militant groups Nigeria cannot thrive if any part of it is trapped in conflict and violence. We have to give peace a chance in the Niger Delta. We are currently reviewing the implementation of the Niger Delta Amnesty Programme, to determine the shortcomings, and areas for reform The issues presented ranged from Infrastructure needs to the strengthening of institutions like the NDDC, and matters of fiscal federalism. At our meeting today the Leaders and Stakeholders of the Niger Delta, led by Chief Edwin Clark, presented a list of 16 issues for dialogue. Meeting with Niger Delta Stakeholders this afternoon: Governors, former Govs, Ministers, Legislators, Traditional Rulers, Activists, Youths We will protect the lives and wellbeing of these most vulnerable of Nigeria's citizens. And we will ensure they return safely to their homes Let me assure that these very distressing reports will not be taken lightly. We will act decisively on the findings of the investigations. I have seen the new @hrw report, and asked the Inspector-General of Police and concerned State Governors to investigate immediately Deeply worrying to hear the reports of sexual abuse and exploitation of women and girls by security personnel in IDP camps in the Northeast When the world stands together, it will be impossible for evil to triumph over good. Days after the attempt on the holy city of Makkah, Maiduguri suffered an attack. We must rally together &amp; not allow ourselves to be cowed.

Things must change. - GMB But over the last several years our refineries have declined, and we are at the mercy of imports. In my time as NNPC chairman and Petroleum Minister in the late 70s, 2 of our 4 refineries were built, and domestic consumption catered for.

My deep faith in the democratic process assures me that with your support, our country will certainly overcome. in the face of certain defeat at the polls. in the country and provide further justification to those who would want to exploit every situation to frustrate the democratic process Our country is going through difficult times in the hands of terrorists. Any act of violence can only complicate the security challenges But we must remain calm and peaceful, while resolute. Do not allow yourself be tempted or provoked to violence As a Nigerian and a candidate in the elections, I share in the disappointment and frustration at this decision To be clear, the postponement is a fraudulent attempt to subvert Nigeria's democracy. The world has seen this clearly My friends, I know many of you have waited for me to speak about the postponement of elections yesterday. - GMB Change may be postponed, but it cannot be denied. #ThingsWILLchange Nigeria has decided: #Change cannot be postponed.

We can all feel it coming. #ThingsMustChange - GMB. I again call on security agencies to promptly arrest and prosecute all those found guilty of violence in any form. This is an urgent duty. Elections are not war. Politics is not a battle. Violence and hate speech by supporters of any of the candidates is not acceptable. As I have continued to repeat at rallies and in the media, it is our collective responsibility to ensure campaigns remain peaceful. The only effective way to register our rejection of the present failure in governance is to vote peacefully and protect our votes peacefully Good morning my friends, as our message of #Change continues to sweep around the country; we re-iterate our call against violence - GMB @Lahjussi @uniosunAMEBOR Thank you!:) We hope you have your PVC though? #ThingsMustChange Please join the #IHaveDecidedmovement. Take a photo, wear a T-shirt, and sign up to volunteer for change on http://t.co/PUiiCqH3MP The #IHaveDecided campaign is a deeply inspiring one. It is time for every one of us to decide. Follow @IHaveDecidedNG. #ThingsMustChange Join us as we continue the relentless pace of our rallies in Minna and Kaduna today. #Change is finally here, my friends. - GMB We insist on a campaign of hope, change and the future. This election is about big, important issues. We refuse to play it small. Therefore, I shall refuse to indulge the smear campaign. I refuse to allow them take away the focus from the issues that concern you. I am appealing to you: the damage to this country is great. The level of unemployment and insecurity is intolerable, worsened by corruption. Let us focus on those issues, please. Elections are not war. February 14 is not about politicians. It is about our country. Imagine the accelerated growth we can now achieve in a democracy –which the world has seen to be the most effective way of governing nations We are lucky to have in this election two people who have led this country. I am proud to present our record of solutions and effectiveness. We have presented our vision and plans – through our manifesto (available on http://t.co/mpQkYuVlSg) and our town hall meetings. We have only presented our record – how we fought insurgencies, how we stabilised the naira, how we tackled corruption. Can our president keep us safe when we travel to any part of this country? Is your life better today than it was six years ago? Do our children find it easy to get jobs? Do our sisters and brothers find it easy to set up and sustain their businesses? We are concerned only about his record – has he secured Nigeria? Has he fought corruption? Has he truly grown the economy so it can work? We have not spoken about the President's family, his health, his religion, his ethnic group, or his phone number. We do not have a disinformation or propaganda wing in our campaign. We have no need to waste time in driving petty attacks. Our President and his allies must remember that he is not only a candidate for office; he is the President of Nigeria. We should be deeply worried that a President who called for calm during governorship elections has now lost his cool in his own elections. Where is his fabled calm, where is his reserve, where is his composure? Why is he so ruffled? Why is he so frustrated and afraid? How can a President who has led this country for six years be unable to run on his own record and his achievements? How can his campaign be talking about dead ex-leaders, jogging around the stadium and outright lies about my health? How can the President of this country be talking about remembering phone numbers and coup speeches? All of us, citizens and voters need to ask ourselves – why is our President so desperate? What is this obsession with lies? What is this obsession with pettiness? What is this obsession with threats and attacks? The desperation is beyond my understanding. #ThingsMustChange This campaign should be about those issues. It should be about today and the future; about securing Nigerian lives and Nigerian land. The businesses of our enterprising youth are being killed by lack of access to finance and poor economic policies. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Nigerians died in #Baga days ago. Our unemployment numbers are rising. It is a tragedy to see the ruling party focus on pettiness and lies; rumours of cancer, foreign treatment, and certificates they know exist. Why should candidates tell so many frantic lies in order to win elections, if truly their purpose is to ‘transform’ the lives of our people? I have run for office before, but I have consistently done so without desperation or anger, because elections are not war. I clearly underrated the panic and lack of integrity that leads people to tell barefaced lies, and must confess, it continues to confound me I have become seriously disturbed by the volume of falsehood and desperation from the opposition campaign of the PDP. Good morning, my friends. As we continue our relentless pace campaigning for #Change this week, let’s reflect on the past few weeks -GMB GMB shares a laugh with #TeamGMB this morning after reading the tweets about @Zahra3_!:) #ThisIsBuhari http://t.co/AYh4eRCUPF Achu'Benue a'wainya! Agba, Kogi! We bring our urgent message of #Change to you today! #APCRally #GMB15 #ThingsMustChange May they never be forgotten. May the labour of heroes past never, ever be in vain. God bless their families, and God bless Nigeria. Today, we have nothing but gratitude for the sacrifice made by those who lay down their lives to keep our country safe. @Jite_O Dear friend, our plans are clearly spelt out in the manifesto on http://t.co/AI7SabQI3s and our videos on YouTube. #GMB15 Good morning, Nigeria. #ThingsMustChange Let these thoughts guide us. Let these thoughts speak to us. Let them shape our opinions, our choices. We are better than this. Do you want a country where you cannot say for certain, if our enemies come at us, you have a government that can and will protect you? Beyond the politics, and the rhetoric, ask yourself this: Do you truly want a country where your life is not safe? #ThingsMustChange These Nigerians who have died because our government cannot protect them, they are not politicians. They deserve better. We deserve better. We must ask ourselves these questions - how did we become like this? How did we get to this point? What kind of country have we become? We cannot be the country that loses the essence of our humanity, the meaning of empathy. Nigerians are dying everyday due to incompetence. It is unacceptable to ignore or minimise the deaths of Nigerian citizens because of elections. It is heart-breaking. This must change. The responsibility of the Nigerian government is to protect and respect the lives of Nigerians, regardless of politics, or elections. Every Nigerian life is sacred. On #Baga, 150 or 2000, every Nigerian life matters. We cannot continue like this. #ThingsMustChange It's a wrap. Daalu nu, ndi Imo! The energy today was incredible. The Igbo have spoken: Buhari for President! #GMB15 http://t.co/5zfl8J2Khm Please follow us live on @channelstv today as we inaugurate the Presidential Campaign Secretariat in Abuja. #Change #GMB15 Happy Sunday to everyone. #Change is coming to Nigeria. - GMB After a week on the road, I return to the joy of my grandchild. I do this for them. Our children deserve more - GMB http://t.co/p6c9sDuZxY We can and we will bring #Change to Nigeria peacefully. I call on the PDP to join this call for peace. Every Nigerian life is sacred - GMB Like I said after the attack on our supporters in Rivers this week, elections are not war. Electoral violence is unacceptable - GMB I have received news of violence in Jos today. I condemn this violence in its entirety. I reject any supporter who resorts to violence - GMB We insist on peace during these elections, and always. Politics is not war. Elections are not a battle. Violence is strongly condemned. GMB and leadership of the APC observe a full minute silence for victims of the Baga Massacre. #WeAreAllBaga #APCRally http://t.co/u40wNHfNv2 #ThisIsBuhari. http://t.co/KulfBX4DEr Terrible news from Baga.

Akwa Ibom, isongo! #GMB15 #APCRally Our Port Harcourt rally is live on NTA, AIT and Channels TV #APCRally #ThingsMustChange #GMB15 Please see a 1-minute video of GMB delivering this morning's tweets here: http://t.co/8m72OccNOG #GMB15 I am Muhammadu Buhari, and I am running for President to change this country, for good. - GMB Thank you and God keep us all. Vote APC. Vote #Change. Let me make you this promise today: We will protect your children. We will protect your wealth. We will make this country work again. My only desire is to prove to you that Nigeria can truly work. Allow me prove to you that in your lifetime, you can be proud of this country The task ahead will be challenging and daunting, but it is surmountable. This is what leadership is about. #ThingsMustChange Government will conduct itself in a disciplined and responsible manner; we will identify problems and fix them. #ThingsMustChange Corruption will be a thing of the past and we will ensure that wealth goes around our citizens in an equitable manner. This is my promise: We will work hard and fast for you. Our children will go to school and they will return safe. This is why I am running for the office of the president of Nigeria. This is my promise. #ThingsMustChange And, no, it does not matter if you are Christian, Muslim, animist or atheist: we need a new direction under a new leadership. My dear friends, this is very important to note: It doesn’t matter if you are Igbo, Yoruba, Ijaw, Hausa, Idoma, Efik, Ekwere, Urhobo, Igala What is going on here? In this our country? In a country that belongs to all of us? #ThingsMustChange How can we allow the cowards of Boko Haram take over any part of this country - a sovereign state? #ThingsMustChange How can 12 young people die because they were looking for jobs in Abuja and justice is not met? Several corruption scandals unsolved. How can 219 girls be missing in our country, and our leader appears incapable of action? #ThingsMustChange So don’t let anyone blind you with fear so they can continue to plunder our resources, and keep you away from our common wealth. and face the full wrath of the law as punishment for their crimes against our country. #ThingsMustChange As your President, their punishment won't stop there, we will also ensure Boko Haram and other such elements, are found, are arrested I have and will continue to condemn those who burn God's places of worship, be they churches or mosques and wish God's judgment upon them. Even as Head of State, we never imposed Sha’riah. All my running mates have been either Igbo or Yoruba and always Christian. Because they cannot attack our record, they accuse us falsely of calling for election violence - when we have only insisted on peace. Because they can't attack our record, they accuse me falsely of ethnic jingoism; they accuse me falsely of religious fundamentalism. The world admired us. We were proud to be Nigerians. #ThingsMustChange We rebuilt industries, Nigerians queued up and treated each other with respect; Nigerians took pride in our reputation for discipline. We shouldn't forget so soon that there was Maitatsine ravaging the north east and we dealt with it. We also overran the Chadian rebels. In our government, we fought corruption, we stabilised the naira, and we shut down insurgencies. #ThingsMustChange I have led this country and I have a record. We were not perfect, but we were effective; we solved problems, and we made Nigerians proud. People accuse me of many things. But one thing they never accuse me of is corruption. They never accuse me of mediocrity, or of lying. Are our parents safe when we leave them at home? Is the naira in your bank account of greater value today than it was four years ago? Can you honestly, truly say to yourself that our country has changed for the better? Are our children safe when they go to school? Many people ask me: why am I running for office again? And I ask them – "What has changed since I began this mission?" "and nothing will change." But is that really true? It is not. And so you forgive politicians for stealing and for mediocrity – because you say to yourselves, "they are all thieves, they are all selfish" Many of you believe something is wrong with Nigeria. Some of you have given up. You think this country can not be good; cannot get better. Good morning, my friends. Before we kick off our rallies in Port Harcourt this morning, let us talk, Nigerian to Nigerian - GMB @jassie_d1 Hello Jassie. The manifesto is on the website http://t.co/q77AkU7lIX #GMB15 To the question 'how', see our clear plans on http://t.co/AI7SabQI3s. We also share my vision/plans directly in videos on our Youtube page. Today, with Governor Fashola and Pastor E.A. Adeboye at the Lagos State Annual Thanksgiving Service. #GMB15 http://t.co/n6eL7CQuri "The job of government is security and peace not religion." I shared a few words at the Lagos Annual Thanksgiving Service: 
"All Nigerians must be free to worship God regardless of their beliefs" -GMB @ProfOsinbajo and I in Lagos today. Nigerians are ready to see a country they can be proud of. #ThingsMustChange http://t.co/maLAdnn43N The excitement was palpable as we met Nigerians today. This chef told me, "Sir, you have to win". #ThingsMustChange http://t.co/r9zx49HcsZ Four years after my last, I sat for a conversation with my friend @MoAbudu today in Lagos. #ChangeIsFinallyHere - GMB http://t.co/CIypPE2HL1 @ProfOsinbajo and I today.

We shall shortly also upload the road-map. #ThingsMustChange #GMB15 A country defined by corruption, by mediocrity, by waste and by insecurity cannot deliver the future that we desperately need. #Change Remind everyone you meet and know that we cannot settle for a Nigeria of the barest minimum, when we can build a truly great country. Don't forget, we cannot afford to be distracted. The urgent issues are: Security, the Economy (Jobs, Power), Tackling corruption #SET - GMB I thank everyone who has spent the past few weeks with us pushing our message and driving our vision. #ThingsMustChange - GMB Why do kids like to put two fingers in the air? #ThingsMustChange:) http://t.co/772Vz2Cs8t It was a blessing to spend time with my grandchildren yesterday at home. How were your holidays? http://t.co/VoqZEBKmNs The site is now live. You can go to FactChecki.ng now. Happy New Year to you and yours. #GMB15 #ThingsMustChange.

Hello, 2015. http://t.co/VqNx1CFwTz Thank you and God bless Nigeria. #ThingsMustChange - GMB. Once again, I wish everyone - those who believe in our mission and those who don't yet agree with us - a happy and prosperous New Year. This is the promise that 2015 holds. That is the promise that change will bring. That is the promise that I bring to you. Together, we can build a nation that is secure, prosperous and gives everyone a fair chance. and your energy and your passion to see change. You must never give up on Nigeria. No. If you give up, then all hope is truly lost. You should also never give in to the temptation to feel so weighed down by those who have failed you that you lose your hope and your Elections are not war. Politics is not a battle. We can, and we will, bring this #Change to Nigeria peacefully and by focusing on solutions. Yes, you are disappointed and you are angry, as you are entitled to be. But you must not be so angry that you become violent. Oh, my dear friends, this New Year, more than ever before, I am hopeful about Nigeria. This hope inspires and excites me. Are these things truly possible? Of course. That is the essence and outcome of leadership. #ThingsMustChange To the question 'how', see our clear plans on http://t.co/AI7SabQI3s. I also share my vision/plans directly in videos on our Youtube page. so that you can create value, build the economy and aggressively expand wealth. 5. A Nigeria where entrepreneurship thrives, enterprise flourishes and the government supports you and then gets out of your way 4. A country that provides jobs, reducing unemployment to the lowest of single digits and providing safety nets so no one is left behind. respect for the environment as my friend @estherclimate has asked me; education that is outcome-oriented in a knowledge-economy. 3. A Nigeria where citizens get the basics any country should provide: infrastructure that works, quality healthcare that is accessible, 2. A Nigeria in which neither yourselves, nor your parents, families or friends will have to fear for your safety, or for theirs. and lead with vision and clarity; where the stories that emerge to the world from us are full of hope and progress. Change means: 1. A country you can be proud of at anytime and anywhere: where corruption is tackled, where your leaders are disciplined Now some of you have asked me: what exactly does ‘change’ mean? On this special day, let me remind you in five short statements. I have unshakeable faith that 2015 will be the year of change. #ThingsMustChange. A story of genuine investment in our children and students, be they in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka or Delta State University, Abraka. A story of our youth creating jobs and expanding the frontiers of innovation and creativity everywhere from @MAVINRECORDS to @Cc_HUB. I have faith that 2015 is the year we shall begin to write a new story. #ThingsMustChange The beauty of the New Year is that we can look forward with renewed hope and the knowledge that things can and will change. 2014 was a challenging one for most citizens of our dear country. Yes, it is enough for you to despair. But, please, do not. I am sharing a New Year's Day message to Nigerians in general, but I find it crucial to send another message directly to Nigeria’s youth.
