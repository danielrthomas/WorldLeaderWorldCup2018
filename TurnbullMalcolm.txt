Labor ignored places like Ocean Grove while overbuilt HFC areas w fibre. No prioritisation based on need. @macleanbrendan we have to do both - because our job is made so much harder by the mess they left us. Labor's plan penalized underserved areas by not prioritizing them and making them wait longer and pay more. So whose plan is fairer? 2/2 Two facts: our approach to NBN will address underserved areas sooner, and the service will be more affordable 1/2 @jden @SaysJuliaKeady well I have been minister for six months. Labor had six years and did nothing. We are the first Gvt ever to actually ascertain the relative quality of bband across Australia. Labor simply didn't care about bband divides @SBSNews @linnytayls fact is that precincts like Ocean Grove will get upgraded much sooner under our plan - underserved areas are priority. @newscomauHQ @harrytuckerr when did journalists stop reporting what people say and instead put ludicrous words in their mouths instead?

Fine if you are rich &amp; have good bbnd now. But if you're not - not so much @noplaceforsheep truth hurts doesn't it? Labor's bungling has wasted billions and caused many without bbnd to go without for years. @Gab282 apart from fact it costs much more, takes much longer and is therefore less affordable. @noplaceforsheep so what about ALP effort in regions - satellite service wh doesn't work, wireless solution which lacks sufficient spectrum. Labor on the other hand didn't assess relative bbnd quality and rolled out fttp in some areas wh already had v good bbnd Key difference bet'n our approach to NBN and Labor's is that we will prioritise the least well served areas - 1.6m prems w no or v poor bbnd This is what I said last night about #ABC - http://t.co/mxex6tSnE3 How Labor promised wireless broadband without having the spectrum to deliver it. http://t.co/yizRGQT3KJ @SaysJuliaKeady @SaveTheNBN okay how far are you from the pillar in the street? @mdhoad @SaysJuliaKeady but also interesting to know why someone to whom bband is so vital wd buy a new house where she says there is none @mdhoad @SaysJuliaKeady of course it's my job to complete the NBN and I will do so sooner cheaper and more affordably than Labor cd ever do @SaysJuliaKeady no - just asking you a simple question which you refuse to answer. @SaysJuliaKeady no I am simply asking whether given the importance of bband to you, you checked availability before buying yr new house. @KnottMatthew @Colvinius @smh why then did none of the other 100 journos present spin the speech in the same misleading way you did? @pandymonium01 the quotes look right to me and of course do not remotely support the headline. @Colvinius @smh @KnottMatthew the quotes look okay.

Transcript &amp; video:  Arguments in Favour of Electronic Voting | Malcolm Turnbull MP: http://t.co/jonRUs9Dzk Congratulations Craig Laundy winning Reid for the Liberal Party for the first time in history! @latikambourke okay see you there @aimee_maree @latikambourke I have done just that many times. @latikambourke sure. What time @latikambourke good morning to you too. Very windy in Sydney. @GalacticWomanAu @latikambourke @Silk_Andrew that's not right - appears about 90% fail to fill in the ballot paper correctly inadvertently @latikambourke very good. Wasn't sure if you were upbraiding me for "preaching" or exhorting me to greater feats of advocacy. @latikambourke explain! @Maxwell1938 @FinancialReview very hard to pull the copper out of the ducts you have put the fibre in w/out damaging the fibre. @KielSmith @beth_hewitt on that basis over 600,000 Australians failed to have their say at election because of their own clerical error. @beth_hewitt @KielSmith so what % of your informal votes wd you regard as being deliberately informal? Thanks @naomiwoodley for discussing informal votes and electronic voting with me. Hope you can fit it into @amworldtodaypm tomorrow morning. @KielSmith thanks Kiel - that's the experience everywhere @JeremyTravers that's true too. Wd certainly reduce inadvertent informal votes @TeradataANZ that is very common I fear and very illegal @SentinelMet if its at the polling station and not via Internet security much enhanced cf to current paper system. Most informal HoR votes have voted "1" only - optional pref in some states exacerbates. Elec voting wd prompt voter to number all boxes The growing level of informal votes in the HoR v worrying. A good argument for electronic voting at the polling station. @DalrympleWill that seems quite a lot. Are you going to list them in your next book? @MsCastan tired perhaps definitely not emotional! Very busy today getting ready for next week and on Sky Viewpoint last night FYI @JB_AU anytime. We hold our most well attended public meetings in pubs here in Wentworth. @JB_AU I don't think you have my best interests at heart.

I have produced two policies in this campaign. The broadband policy published in April and the ICT policy issued on Monday. @senthorun @triplej the answer to that question is so obvious it doesnt need to be stated. I read  policy shortly before going on @triplej I did my best to make sense of it, until I could ensure it was authoritatively corrected. Here is another link to our correction confirming we oppose a mandatory filter and oppose an opt out filter http://t.co/1SVFNO0sgK @srpeatling a lot of interest in internet freedom - so a good sign I guess. @chriskennett our policy is as stated tonight. No mandatory filter. No opt out filter. In other words - no mandatory filter, no opt out filter, but support parents taking resp'y for their own kids' activity online. Position is Coalition will encourage carriers to make software available for parents to install on own devices to protect kids. Policy released today wrongly indicated we supported an opt out system of internet filtering. That is not our policy and never has been. The Coalition has never supported mandatory internet filtering. Indeed, we have a long record of opposing it. @rwerkh @joshgnosis The policy was in error - I would never support a mandatory internet filter.
