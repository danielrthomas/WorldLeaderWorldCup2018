and start laying the foundations for growth if we could begin to reduce poverty how can we not believe in everything we can achieve for the future what is worth and what lasts is not done from one day to the next it is done working one day after  the other we are the generation that is changing our country forever we are the generation that had the courage to put the truth on the table together we set out to get the country from where it was so as not to keep repeating the usual mistakes this year we will finish a work every days a work that will forever change the lives of millions of from 15 productive sectors 13 are growing hand in hand with construction which took  impulse for the credits and the public work that advances in our country last year we achieved many things together we generated more than 500 thousand jobs and achieved that more than 5000 people per day out of poverty we have been growing for seven consecutive quarters the path of truth leads to real solutions i know that many find it hard to believe many times they told us something that was not but this time its serious together were taking new steps  firm and safe to continue improving i am convinced that if everyone puts their part and between all we begin to lower the consumption of gas and electricity we will achieve three things pay less take care of the environment and we will not leave debt to our children and grandchildren for the energy that we have to import i know what weighs a rate update in the pocket of each one of you i understand what happens to them i know its not easy if there was another way  believe me i would have done it what more do i want the to have everything and easier here for you if we look at gas consumes 70 more than and at similar temperatures but in they pay 134 more expensive and in three times more than us in electricity an average household consumes 52 more than a household in and more than double that in but we pay 40 less than  and almost half of what the pay without energy we can not continue growing with energy they can not stop us the only way to achieve a profound and true change is for all to assume the challenge of consuming less every light that we extinguish every stove every tap that we close everything adds up today i want to ask all municipalities and provincial governments to eliminate the taxes they charge on public services a yes  they will help to alleviate the burden of each consumer each trade and each we all have to make an effort in this great challenge from the government we have already started we are building gas pipelines to take gas to where it was not before we are accompanying of every households in the country with the social rate to cover these subsidies we had to borrow the other alternative would have been to make an adjustment shock and that is not the path we chose  we choose the path of change with gradualism so that no is left behind it is a lie that the subsidies to gas and electricity are not paid by anyone we pay them all with more inflation and debt to pay for energy we have to borrow money which generates a debt to our children and grandchildren that is the backpack that we are leaving them that is the lie that hurt us the most energy is not free costs because it costs to produce it  because it costs to transport it and it costs that it arrives at each house within the expenses one of the biggest are the subsidies to the energy that were of 125000 million weights subsidies are not free as we were led to believe for many years when we arrived we inherited a state that spent and still spends much more than it enters in 2017 the had revenues of almost billion pesos which come mostly from taxes and spent  400000 million pesos more than what he received the project is successful

to do our part so that we never have to regret inequality again the most valuable thing that a woman can have is the freedom to choose to be the owner of her life another important issue is the licenses we want to expand a series of licenses such as assisted fertilization adoption and paternity which is fundamental to move towards a shared parenting i work so that each woman can go as far as she wants we can not allow a woman to earn less than a man it has no meaning or explanation equal pay has to  be a reality throughout the country today we present a bill to advance equality of opportunities at all levels especially in the workplace we need a change so that we do not lose more talent capacity creativity and the opportunity to be a stronger more plural and more just country we are clear that this is not a womens issue it is an issue that involves everyone and society because every woman who fails to develop  its potential is a loss for all women devote twice as much time to unpaid work and this limits their possibilities to develop a project in the future today there are more women who do not have a registered job compared to men they have my absolute commitment to move towards equal opportunities between women and men the time has come to take a step beyond and take advantage of this date to achieve concrete progress and not just words i want to say hello to

in my heart i declare inaugurated the ordinary session of this honorable of the  we all need each other and we need each other together our true enemies are resignation and indifference lets encourage them to defeat them with enthusiasm with courage with strength i invite those who think differently i ask you to open your mind and your heart that perhaps what we are proposing with absolute good faith works and is working i invite you to the enthusiasm of doing to the pride of knowing that we are the generation that is changing forever if we could avoid the crisis that was coming if we could generate work and begin to reduce poverty if we could pave whole neighborhoods that were submerged in mud if we could move from isolation to integration with the world lets imagine everything we can achieve we already surpassed the number of people employed in 2015 and wages beat inflation in we had record sales of cement asphalt cars and  motorcycles tourism and passenger flights to mention some of the most visible examples all this activity is generating work everything we achieved together in these two years shows that we are growing the investment increases last year it grew 11 and it is precisely that investment that guarantees us that we will continue growing because it enlarges our capacity to produce have everything to grow depends on us and no one else i am convinced that we are going to do it i know that if we work together if we talk and do things with good intentions we will take big steps in each of the challenges that i proposed in this work agenda as i said more than once i am in favor of life but i am also in favor of the mature and responsible debates that we as have to give ourselves for this reason we are pleased that includes this topic in its agenda of  this year years ago a very sensitive debate was postponed as a society we owe abortion we are working with the and team in a comprehensive initiative so that schools health centers and communities have professionals who advise children in education reproductive health and contraceptive methods once again the starting point is education sex education is a tool that empowers young people it helps them make informed decisions 11 we have to put on the table the unintentional teenage pregnancy our country shows a critical situation each year more than 100000 girls under 19 get pregnant and out of 10 of those pregnancies are not intentional we can not do politics with the education of our children we can not remember education only at the time of the meetings the quality  in education it is a commitment that we have to assume together families teachers and the entire educational community 10 we have to work for educational equality so that all children especially the most vulnerable can access quality education out of children are overweight or obese we are working to have access to fresher and healthier foods food is today a global theme similar to the defense of the environment i ask that we work together to combat malnutrition and childhood obesity which affects the least in out of 10 children are malnourished we are the country with the highest childhood obesity in we are going to promote a draft criminal code which for the first time introduces strong penalties to drivers who put the lives of others at risk for driving alcoholics under the effect of drugs  or greatly exceeding the allowed speed we are working to make routes safer we repaired thousand kilometers of routes that were in poor condition and we are recovering 12 thousand more we finish and we will have almost 1700 kilometers of highways at work life is the most important thing we have and we are killing ourselves in road accidents and on the streets throughout the country last year more than 5000 people died that did not have to die it is a national tragedy another important reform is that of the procedure code the center of the reform is to move from the current model in which the judges are the ones who investigate and those who decide later to a faster model which gives more prominence to the prosecutors we need some reforms like the one in the code we have an old code messy and patched a thousand times since last year there is an expert commission preparing a new penal code  more modern which will be finished within a few months it is important that we advance in the termination of dominion and that the state recover the assets of drug trafficking and organized crime this strategy is working the seizures of drugs are record more than 300 tons the number of robberies was reduced by 11 and homicides by more than 20 in these two years and the fight against drug trafficking are two of the biggest demands of for the first time we have a national strategy to address these issues the women and men of our security forces are risking their lives for us and deserve all our respect and admiration we do not believe that we have to fall into the hard hand or abolitionism to solve it we believe in a system that puts the victims of crime at the center that respects the security forces and that offers penalties proportional to the crimes  committed want to live in peace we want to go out without fear and that our children live quietly we believe that in these years of democracy a tension between democracy and security persists we have decided to preserve an important part of mayo and transform it into a it will be one of the largest urban national parks in the world and part of the protected area system of the metropolitan area inaugurated the el impenetrable national park in we started to create the in in and in for the first time we are making progress in the creation of also have the right to live near a green place where we can unite know and preserve nature for the first time in years we are expanding the area of parks and we are improving the infrastructure  of which we already had we want all to be connected to have access to the and better connection in cell phones in these two years we accelerated the growth of the fiber optic which already has more than 32000 km and connects more than 400 localities there is a revolution in the whole country with tourism last year we broke many records never before had so many travelers stayed in hotels across the country and had never traveled so many people on domestic flights as now in a world of equals there is no reason for a father to only have two days in the moment of the birth of the children we are going to present a bill to extend paternity leave they have my commitment so that the egalitarian salary that our laws establish becomes a reality we can not allow more than one woman to earn less than a man its not fair not well according  women charge almost 30 less than men this can not go on like this in in workers is in informality we are going to present the draft so that thousands of informal workers can register without losing their seniority and the benefits that correspond to them for their years of work we have to organize ourselves for the work of the 21st these years we achieved agreements that generate employment and opportunities unemployment is falling and the total number of registered workers increased by almost 270 thousand all this was possible among other reasons because inflation is falling inflation in 2017 was lower than in 2016 this years inflation will be lower and next years inflation will be even lower than that of this year another priority is that all can access credit and can save we are living a boom  of mortgage credit 2017 was the year with the most mortgage loans in almost 20 years after decades of disorder it was time to be serious about fiscal balance it is the silver of the and administering it responsibly is our obligation improved the positions and ratings of the index we went from position 106 to 85 in two years it is the first time that improves 21 positions in two years in these two years the officials set limits as never before to guarantee that we are not here to benefit now there are rules on how to show assets which resolve possible conflicts of interest and rules that define limits for naming family members we want a state at the service of the people a modern and facilitating state that gives the tools to the to improve their lives and obliges the officials to render accounts  in this context today i want to propose a work agenda with concrete challenges to continue growing we choose the path of change with gradualism a path in which all are united by effort some criticize us for going too slow and others for going too fast the former call for an adjustment shock but we came to reduce poverty and ensure that no go hungry the worst has already happened and now come the years in which we are going to grow the transformations that we made begin to bear fruit to feel thank you for understanding that this is an effort we make together working together thank you for setting the path and choosing the truth although sometimes it is uncomfortable thank you for understanding that things take time that there are no shortcuts or magic solutions it is the third time that i come to this at
