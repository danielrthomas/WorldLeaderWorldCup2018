fellow citizens sometimes think that we do not defend their interests on the contrary we are constantly in action to defend the interests of the its a gateway to the distances between and are abolished by history language and friendship you have developed in a fertile ecosystem in terms of artificial intelligence i hope that we better frame these innovations to put the human in the heart  of innovation many people wonder if the relationship in is emotional or strategic she is at the same time emotional and strategic we will show our middle classes and our citizens that our international action will protect them and their interests press conference with premier of some will recognize themselves thousands of people come to work live and sometimes fall in love with our brothers in meeting with pastry chefs of the president can not be denied but neither do we need to be signed because these countries represent values they represent an economic market  force maybe its

interests lets look at history isolationism  is bad for the people i think president knows it lets work together on a new framework agreement to deal with nuclear and regional activity lets have a dynamic of work to bring down the tensions our relationship is growing we have just launched a council of that will meet every two years it is inappropriate to use the reference to national security between allies and friends to justify trade sanctions the trade war is good for no one starting with the workers renovate the global framework of trade but respect the rules of the collective game to try to convince to hold the in the concert of the nations but without ever yielding anything of our interests or our values in the coming days will be there  for the to defend its values the context

locked in a vision of a of cities and a of fields we will and mobilize all energies we will meet every two months we will simplify and accelerate assistance to associations that do essential work in neighborhoods we must give the youth other models this is not the problem of neighborhoods it is the problem of everyone radicalization is gaining in some  neighborhoods there is no fatality our path of ridge to be intractable on the radicalization without stigmatizing a religion we will generalize testing to ensure that there is no discrimination in hiring it was impunity when there were outrages sexist neighborhoods now its in the law it will be penalized it is known but it is not the good address we can not allow discrimination to take hold there is a rule we will enforce it everywhere the antisemitic speech is not discourse is not people have become accustomed to antisemitic discourses in neighborhoods thinking it was the antidote to racism they are wrong squared they will find me on their way  its always the same thing we plate public policies from above we put the means and on the ground we say its not for us neighborhood youth do not want special treatment they want access like others sporting success can give access to employment the state must facilitate sports initiatives so that it goes faster and stronger we need all our young people from  can find this internship we must mobilize everyone we will set up a scholarship internship in the internship in a company in the college has become an obsession in the neighborhoods this is what we can not get but it is also what allows to have a fulcrum to leave the house arrest to build equality from the youngest age we will build 30000 additional cr\u00e8che places in the period the will finance a bonus of 1000  by place in the political districts of the city to make this right real put everyone around the table to the equipment of our territories the conditions for this funding must be created within the national territorial cohesion agency we must also change our strategy stop putting the most disadvantaged populations in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods we have been there for year those who have not succeeded for 20 years its not my fault we will launch an initiative in heart  of area time is money hence the goal of shaking up habits and quickly when one is afraid to leave ones home or leave ones family alone one can not build ones future we must build security and justice everyone is a player in collective protection when we refuse to put an end to the violence in his neighborhood we become somehow  so complicit we must build a society of vigilance in all neighborhoods when someone is stuck if he is not a terrorist or about to be its wider it is an intelligence instrument for services we did not wait for the general mobilization on the neighborhoods to act we split the classes in the and at the beginning of 2017 we have already started the experimentation of the police of the daily we deployed health homes in neighborhoods the objective of our policy to make that everywhere in all the places of the each and everyone regains its dignity not going to announce a city plan or a suburban plan this strategy is as old as me the first plan of this kind was presented by it brought some things but we are at the end of what it has  could produce with this method neighborhood residents often feel locked in by a glass ceiling today we put them back to the heart welcome to the it is no longer possible to announce suburban plans by thinking that they will apply themselves it has already been done it has failed changing the everyday life of the suburbs  it starts by putting around the table the people who live there so this morning i receive the members of the of that the faces of neighborhoods change the first electric made in you dieter for your commitment your choice of investing in shows that is back be pragmatic we will still experience periods of tension but we must continue relentlessly to build stability and peace in the history has come back and the time for decisions is here the 2015 agreement on nuclear power is a good deal this agreement can be supplemented to take into account the concerns  of all we want to continue the and build a framework of trust in the which alone will prevent escalation if we want to have a stronger union we need to reform it before expanding it the are under a lot of pressure our interest and our responsibility to anchor the countries to the this calling into question our unity press conference in across the world lesbian gay bisexual and trans people are victims of discrimination and violence and even sentenced to death we all have the right to be ourselves denying that right and suffering is

of having sovereignty develop solidarity and give no ground  we overcome nationalist tendencies by confessing to sovereignty by showing solidarity and not backsliding prize i la young people have great expectations of because they remember their history prize youth sets  on because she is aware of her history prize a prize ha no prize chi ha non said there was no future for said has no future

protection of the environment on the initiative of the resolution of the for the was approved at the said that had no future i believe in a stronger citizenship but it will not come to replace the nationalities she will give them more strength  a heart of very integrated but always open i assume this at several speeds because it is already at several speeds its up to us to accelerate and stop going backwards to overcome nationalisms to assume to have a sovereignty to develop the solidarity and not to let go anything the key to the future sovereignty and solidarity the error of  in recent years is to have left sovereignty to the nationalists to build a more united more sovereign more democratic lets leave the logic where only one is enough to block the club whoever is against must let others go forward but the door must always remain open looks too much at its small differences and forgets its role and unity offers the possibility  to young people to have a adventure it is one of the most beautiful ideas of the construction on universities the idea is not to build new universities but to bring together current universities across with youth to watch live only draws this combination of attachment to freedom  and equality live with youth lets draw together those 30 years of that are before us and lets do it now wake up has changed we are of a that i believe strongly

go out of our way do not be afraid of the world we live in not be afraid of our principles do not betray them the youth expects everything from because it remembers its history the risk today is that of division the only solution that is ours unity divisions push us to inaction the dream is now gnawed by doubt its up to us to decide whether we want to live it or let it die we have chosen to build peace in the  other powers do not respect their word we are the guarantors of stability has experienced this historic miracle of 70 years of peace but if i think of the countries they experienced authoritarianism or totalitarianism to invent submit do not resign yourself in for the this  city at the heart of the history of happy to see the youth commit to bringing our peoples closer together in recent years has split between and on the financial crisis and between and on migration we must recreate solidarity with each of these challenges moving forward on we must overcome our selfishness  and our fears i hope a lot from the chancellor we must live up to this historic moment and work together for a more united more sovereign and more democratic we have decided to stay within the framework of the 2015 nuclear agreement on we have a disagreement with president we can overcome it with a broader negotiation the nuclear agreement  we negotiated it we signed it it allows to control

choose between those who want a of withdrawal and those who are ready to bring a of reinvented sovereignty of a living democracy is a unique space in the world where at the same time we push

think we can be democratic and strong we can hear anger and have the courage to carry out reforms to the end i hear all the social distress and touched by each of them just like you i act at the root to answer it today is 14 months to have asylum in 14 months in precariousness its too long we will reduce this period to months thats what i did  there is anger in the country it goes back a long time ago it is linked to the fact that injustices have settled this anger can only be lifted if we succeed in driving transformations more than sixty gendarmes were wounded in the evacuation operation of the by people who had no reason to be there this is unacceptable we decided not to do the airport of people who occupied the area illegally therefore had no reason to be there as we committed ourselves we restore the republican order i never said or let say that the situation of the was the fault of the railwaymen they run the i respect them here is the vision  in which we register the appointment we have today with our hospital is as important as that of 1957 when we created the public hospital we need to reinvest there are people who work hard but who do not earn enough with their work the reforms we take are first made for them  i do not believe in runoff theory i hear all the rage some are legitimate others are not the international community has gained credibility i want to start by paying tribute to our soldiers thanks to whom the operation in was successful  live i answer questions from and now on and meet you tonight answer and questions live on the phone with and by acting together  in a coordinated way that we will definitely stop the regime from carrying out chemical attacks against its own people the use of chemical weapons endangers the people and our security for all the armed intervention of this night shows our determination of defense 2018  dozens of men women and children were massacred using chemical weapons in on the red line has been crossed i have thus ordered the armed forces to intervene on 2018 in dozens of men women and children were massacred with chemical weapons the red line has been  crossed so i ordered the armed forces to intervene needs but of a closer to you more sovereign more united to put things in the right order is to start by listening to yourself this is what i will do this from 1730 to are part of the dream and inspire our  youth our country needs it we are not an by chance all you will remain lifetime references every athlete in now has a treasure to share sports successes are never individual these are stories of human collectives spirit 23 athletes distinguished themselves at the games but every deserves to be recognized by the nation i wish to host the ski world of 2023 lets show that the flame of and is not extinct i support the candidacy of and the values to which we are all attached have shone we are proud to have participated in these games  whether you are an athlete medalist or not you have shown what can be done with tireless work we are always happy to enter the but today i am proud to welcome the athletes of with our two flagship and and all sportsmen back from live we lived to the rhythm of the feats of it is now time to pay tribute to those who accomplished them reception of athletes who participated in the games many thanks to the students of the school for your welcome counting on you to learn well and tomorrow take your part of our beautiful country what is your plus  big project for the discussion continues with the students of the school we will continue for over 30 years we have not made the reforms we rather told people we will give you money but this money is everyones money is tax squared is the country of  who has this level of public deficit since the longest in people who protest today have no reason to do it there will be no airport i hope that those who have a project can develop it but our fellow citizens have the right to restore public order as of 1st there will be no more expenses on the for companies up to  250 employees because the company is a collective adventure when things improve everyone must be able to enjoy it companies were afraid to hire today they have trouble recruiting why the main battle is training apprenticeship continuing education to gain access to economic activity i want mosque financing to be  organized in a transparent and controlled way the average displacement when you are in the country is 40 km with the drop in speed it will take two minutes more it does not deserve the bloodshed we saw on 1st for years we will lower the maximum authorized speed to on without a central reservation there is a stretch  in this situation here there were deaths in years if this measure reduces the number of deaths it will be useful to pass exams at the end of the year its better to review them there will be no chocolate exam in the republic i know where i want to take the economic country repair what is not working and create new business sectors there is no  cities and a of the fields the rich do not need a president they are doing very well on their own i am the president of all the the heart of the battle for me is work we will not change the country overnight but look at everything done for a year counting on retirees if they  wish to participate in the operation launched by for example or to continue the work they do in associations to answer it it is necessary to put back to work and thus that the work pays better 20 billion wage costs were eliminated and this was replaced by a 17 increase in it requires an effort to retreats its true and i  thank you thanks to the retirees for the effort they provide i announced it during the campaign you have contributed all your life to pay the pensions of your elders but today there are fewer assets to pay pensions more unemployment and longer pensions i never took a pensioner for a wallet the housing tax 13 of the population is already exempt  municipalities are already reimbursed by the state the communes will not lose money thats wrong when i arrived in a mayor said thank you because for the first time in eight years the allocations to the communities have not declined i made that commitment and i kept it in we will continue to against terrorist groups do everything to obtain  a ceasefire providing assistance to civilian populations dismantling the arsenal of chemical weapons preparing the peace of tomorrow on the i asked an effort to 60 of retired people i say thank you and i explain why we will put more resources but that is not enough you have to have a system where you do not pay only for the act but  where one also remunerates the course of health which encourages not to do useless acts in the hospital there are situations of great stress especially when emergencies are saturated this is partly because emergencies have become the first access to care while it costs the community times more than a doctors consultation in where they made a similar reform the service has improved  and the costs have gone down and the state will make efforts it will invest 10 million per day for 10 years and it will gradually resume the debt as the reform will be implemented i am not one of those who want to oppose users to railway workers they are asked to accept that future officers will no longer be hired for status this has been the case since  2001 for postal workers and that does not endanger the public service at risk the company must make efforts to better organize for example the one who manages the station is not the same as the one who manages the platforms the company will reorganize but will remain 100 public users have made efforts in recent years supporting the rise in ticket prices in recent years  on the the objective is not the opinion it is to go after this essential reform so that the railroad is strong in the face of competition for this everyone must make an effort i want to be a country of progress again for everyone it will not happen in a day i ask you to trust me its not true that were right when we stop people from succeeding  there is no justice policy if you do not produce first since the first day we have implemented reforms to simplify the labor law that our economy is leaving the first battle i lead is for the school for example 26000 children who never went to kindergarten will go there i am committed to ensuring that all children leaving know how to read write  count and behave well the walls of the house is to liberate protect and unite is a house where progress has stopped because the fundamentals on which it is built have changed it must be rebuilt on solid foundations to open another 50 years of progress we have evidence that chemical weapons were used by the regime of  live nearly a year after the start of the transformation of our country invited by at in a few moments live on with it will soon be a year since we began the transformation of our country i will be tomorrow in in to answer questions in the  follow us live we are taking action to help the civilian population to open humanitarian access with the and in the field we strengthen our diplomatic action for the prohibition of chemical weapons we continue the exchange of technical and strategic information with our allies to define our reaction which will take place in the coming days there was a good use  of chemical weapons in in this context is leading three actions a common goal the stability of the with prime minister and bin on we must find a political solution to the conflict and support the civilian population we will organize an international humanitarian conference with to carry out this necessary action on i mean all the questions about human rights i also see the modernization project of if there is a chance that his project will succeed it is duty to accompany it press conference with of the of preview of the month

bioethics we are criticized for knowing in advance the results of organized debates we are intimate and profound debates the big migrations will not stop they are the result of major international imbalances we will always stay the course between humanism and pragmatism we need help to keep this speech of realistic humanism on migrants we are accused of not accommodating with enough  generosity or gentleness we are trying to reconcile law and humanity called it prudence two subjects of our time bioethics and migrants these two subjects mobilize our most human part we need to give a course to our action and this course is the man the expects from three gifts the gift of your wisdom the gift of your commitment the gift of your freedom in this moment  of great social fragility i consider it my responsibility not to allow the confidence of to erode with regard to politics the path that the state and the church have shared for so long is now fraught with misunderstanding does not have the function of uprooting from our societies the spirituality that nourishes so many of our fellow citizens has been strengthened by the commitment of catholics the mystery of the colonels heroic conduct

national service will be a school of fraternity its about giving our youth the opportunity to come together around a common issue by breaking down all social barriers to allow commitment is to rediscover the meaning of  what makes the nation our republican crucible i believe in the decentralization of projects and initiatives elected officials carry projects on our territories and are sometimes blocked our job to leave flexibilities for concrete projects the role of the head of is not to do everything but to give the opportunity to others to do we will draw the face of an emancipated and committed we must regain a sense of progress in the face of we will have in the period to invest 15 billion in training we will have to change the rules the heart  of a social policy is first of all to prevent inequalities whether it is school health poverty we must break the impasse where we have been groping for years i am often asked about the social dimension of government policy our responsibility to release nothing of the effort the passion that guides us and the necessary transformation to carry out we all know the time of doubt anger impatience that our country is going through our country is fully aware of the great changes it has to live our nation needs women and men engaged in the political and economic sphere our fellow citizens need everyday heroes to dream about whether they are bakers teachers or caregivers they are the holders of a part of the energy of the nation the  is not an abstract idea every day she is embodied in the women and men who carry the ideals we came out of the emergency but we do not make any effort to rebuild after working session with and of memory and vigilance of every moment to preserve the always fragile achievement of peace union and tolerance 73 years after the liberation of the camp  i strongly condemn the despicable attack in i address my bereaved thoughts to the people of who have suffered too much from

agreement is important and we must find solutions together and fight together against climate change and for  the establishment of international collective rules through press conference with president of the of if we love the mountain only in good weather we do not really like it this white day can not hide the splendor of the pride of our territory and soon we hope world heritage  in the streets of meeting with citizens involved in the precarious collective to bring presence and support to the poor election promise held but its not mine three fights for agricultural sovereignty we need to think spring for our agriculture farmer this  is not a job its a life needs enthusiasts committed it is the strength of a people the exit of the will be built on an independent advice an accountability of the sectors and actors and a more proactive research in the matter we must accompany this transformation was right to awaken the conscience on its up to us to accelerate the transition  to get out of only an everyday mobilization will save the climate nearly 20 of soils present erosion risks i hope we put this fight for the planet at the heart of our productive model a new responsibility weighs on the world that of climate the agricultural sector has an impact on the environment and farmers are the first victims of disruptions  climate the case reminds us that consumer safety comes first there can be no state tolerance for operators who do not abide by the rules is 40 dependent on imported soybeans and 60 on nitrogen fertilizer so we have no real sovereignty i hope we have a real protein sovereignty strategy for years to come our agricultural policy has become too complex we need to move towards a less bureaucratic cap a cap that is a real protection mechanism against the volatility of world prices and prices the battle of openness will be won by and with if we know how to organize ourselves openness to the world is not a danger we must not be afraid of this openness but organize to be the winners sector by sector  for the first time we have a document that comes from the reality of the field establishing a strategy some farmers live with 200 or 300 a month every farmer must be paid the right price paid farmers are not asking for help but not being the only sector where selling at a loss has become the rule and people are attached to a quality diet our gastronomy is high in the colors of agricultural sectors the goal of agriculture to feed and to feed the planet well and above all our country and our continent  to agriculture in there is no divorce between local and global the proof the pride of employees in to work for a global company sees far the company is preparing for the future by becoming involved in social and

for relations with president of the before this week with president of the before being gathered in a few days in for a dedicated to the youth we know how big the expectations are the budget dedicated to equality  between women and men is increasing and will reach more than by 2018 this moment when i arrive at the clarity of the truth and the power of hope we owe the clarity of the truth to women today the mobilization of the whole nation for the equality of women and men begins with the eradication of violence against women this is the indispensable condition  an intimate conviction we should align with the age of sexual majority at 15 years this concern of presumption the time required for speech to free oneself too often runs out of time we will extend it from 20 to 30 years we will create the offense of sexist contempt immediately with a deterrent amount we will create a digital application to facilitate support  victims of and the word must emerge we are going to generalize the places of listening in the work place which allow to accompany the victims in their steps often women are afraid to file a complaint at the police station justice will come to women now not the other way around no cultural exception justifies the barbarity of excision we need to pay special attention to migrant women who seek to flee excision for themselves or their little girls we must make the effort  to better see the signs of women victims of violence for example these repeated passages in the emergency because we are once again fallen on the stairs on the 225 000 women victims of violence in 2016 less than one in five filed a complaint we have some progress to make to help the victims overcome the fear the shame that drives them the number to call 3919  from 2018 in all schools a teaching and prevention module dedicated to the fight against sexism and violence will be integrated not learn porn has gone through the door of schools we can not ignore the kind that makes women an object of humiliation has too often free run on social networks we need to put in place prevention do not deny the difference between women and men its about fighting for nonnegotiable equality between the two sexes this is  our entire society who is sick of sexism so we will take resolute action based on three priorities have committed myself to make the great cause of the period equal to the equality of women and men the first pillar is the fight against violence against women do not want to fall into a society where every relationship between a man and a woman becomes a suspicion of domination for  i will not mention them all they are 123 to be dead in 2016 oppose the vibrant silence of respect a year ago i met at mans a woman who sometimes fought a little alone for equality between men and women with her association this woman was brothers bosses colleagues husbands companions yes most of them  they belong to the nearest circle of victims they are ordinary citizens to whom we have not been able to inculcate the foundations of our social life our society is still culturally marked by sexism this footprint is far from neutral let every woman of the have the right to this cry to this clamor the lid had begun to be lifted by all those who have been fighting for years  in a year the word was released but many still consider that they can not speak over a year ago during the march the subject of violence against women was the first cause of insecurity of proud that the city of my youth shines in for its dynamism all my condolences to the victims of

classes i want to fight three fights with you more than 99 of municipalities are not covered by the contract for more than 99 of municipalities the situation is simple the financial aid of the state  your commune will be maintained and the will not ask you for any compensation for that what credibility would have if it does not fulfill its commitments to its own citizens it was necessary to go to this discourse of shared responsibility congress the government could have continued as has always been the case until now to impose unilateral adjustments but this is not the right method  in these moments that we live made of doubts dramas but also essential ambition so that our country becomes again conquering i need you congress the is not owned by a few it shares with its elected
