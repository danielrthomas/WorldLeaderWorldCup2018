be prof in the the elections in were not in accordance with the standards adopted by the had to be placed on each card and the bro card had several pages well or cards revelation it is interesting whether after the announcement of the official election results the principal will challenge with a faulty test and how will be  defended himself he gives his testimony himself immediately after

in was in until 2010 then so much why is a candidate for the because he is a master in swimming and in he is an invaluable skill was a politician and not it may be worth mentioning that is also a member of the for example a former politician of was a politician and not it may be worth mentioning  that is also a member of the for example was a politician of the is now 1930 in the as you can see winter and in spring maybe thats why the bear overslept and the bear breaks the bar hot tap water policy ceases to be effective when it turns out that the temperature of this water is set in the did anyone associate with skis and yet with your own eyes  i saw and confirm urban intermediary or like a feeds on money for the countryside 22 400600 is 35 times less than the average and if we adopt the it will stay like this for a long time 12 do you think the majority of will be satisfied when todays salaries will be converted into at 42 needs more than just modern  army we must be stronger patriotism we must be stronger morally the extraordinary meeting on convened at the request of and has begun he died after the remnants heartily a very interesting analysis of attitude i would not overestimate capabilities  only make sure that they are not the and their army as a guarantor of stabilization i understand that presenting with a proposal that could not be accepted is a visible sign of the success of east i would not count on that they have told their people since the tsarist times that although they live in poverty their is a proud superpower has nothing weak and undecided for nothing such an attitude only encourages and encourages counts  only with strong and sharp players this is in the and is still trying to fight for his country against the rule in facts stroking an alligator and feeding lambs is not enough to defend them you have to tie your mouth otherwise he will eat young and still have a hand there is no effective policy of the towards taking into account interests this is ruled out and benefits  no and you had to have a policy that would protect you strengthened towards these countries you have an effect with failed completely returned under the influence of after all this is the total flop of this of the eastern its probably a joke which is fully sovereign towards is unfortunately a thing of the past in on freedom and sovereignty and on pork

you kidding i am sorry but i do not deny this is a difficult problem but i think it is possible to consider it in the current situation as for athletes full agreement and this lord is who he represents if there is a military response then we have a world war probably for every athlete at least for the majority a very delicate problem it is difficult to judge i do not deny  just wondering i think you can also discuss it i agree that this is a delicate matter tusk between the sentences says that our will go to because the refusal is an irrelevant demonstration in the current situation an angry rumble of and can give to think this is not a land of gentleness like the and i wonder how it was possible to be so shortsighted in 2010 and talk about trust in and today you can see who is in the palm of your hand  its i apologize for the bluntness but this is a matter of intelligence remember who in 2010 talked about trust in and and handed over to him an investigation into the death

information saying that the was shifted to 1130 and at 1200 i have legislative from 1000 the meetings of the have started i also have to go to the constitutional  realities of the 22 the the world should support the fighters for freedom and not like to wash his hands claiming its your business to explain this yourself 12 president taught us that the reasons are not spread evenly there are those who are fighting for freedom who are right today it is necessary to refer to the parliament and clap after the speech of as we did before the a good moment regarding in the we support the government especially  against change of position on sanctions it is a pity that has not set sanctions before i will now be urging the to introduce sanctions against the authorities it is a pity that the say this since yesterday parliament we did not urge sanctions against the authorities in the the great success of arouses optimism government took him money to prepare him and the guest managed it anyway he collected money on the when  started off in 1989 most of his rivals today were not yet in the world watch for the minister only a school bag all tax cuts etc he made this antisocial in a set increase 67 etc its fun when i listen to how criticize people from the party who in rule did not keep any promises  desperation yesterday own body was covered by the wrote to me a moment ago after the

true it means that this power to save the image and quotes is capable of everything regardless of the letter of the law 12 in the regularly controlled cell pedophile materials were found today the day before leaving jokes thats how the responsibility diminishes  approx i understand what the wants to tell me this is just a summary of yesterdays statements of politicians for example deputy in on the bench they have a contradiction in the message the film about breaks down the transmission of the authorities and regarding the liquidation of the because said if he was a hero who were we affirmative 22 for the in 2004 people like  they should threaten in reservations 12 in in 2004 were an auxiliary contingent for the and the sorry we have such a climate in there will be no cleaner power than ours no one will be under such control and pressure as we do well you know it thank you for drawing attention i do not know how it happened whether or my mistake but i think  however my best wishes but all in a joke and with a smile i suggest so gently to check if agrees because here the mistake can have consequences you forgot about the cigar and on the train to tomorrow my job is waiting for me but i greet you cordially have a nice evening  what can the prosecutor conducting the investigation think when he hears from the prime ministers mouth we are with you when and since when was it known about watches and business relationships where are the standards here give me peace these standards are alien to your ever since it was known about watches and business relationships continued in the prosecutors office is conducting an investigation against the former minister of the government and the prime minister is calling  were with you are you from because the term was unambiguous and referred to the staff on duty there is a group of them we do not understand each other i have not seen you sneering but there were a few people in the discussion who mocked i think thats the vast majority many also have to fight over the strength to earn a good price  and how to identify people who are doing well and therefore 25 million do not care about them a bicycle here i agree with the lord the thing is its not the doctors who are responsible for the fatal system they are also victims a colleague is not an athlete he drives only recreation with his son like the vast majority of people there have not been such waiting times for specialists so far  for any governments before these are the facts unfortunately you have forgotten that the has ruled for over years and a patient without money is in a hopeless situation like never before i understand that in the program there will be a record that everyone who goes skiing should be additionally insured because will not help him and you are also a crook with i admit that i did not think and here i have because its a recent story  weeks unfortunately real and painful as your power just so instead of weeks he will lie in a cast until we have such a climate for your rule these are facts but if he falls over on the ice and breaks his leg hes waiting for a checkup until if he does not pay thanks for such activation of on reveals its vision of the state a decent life only for the rich smart and set thanks for honesty at least  once i am begging you but do you know what a broken thigh bone means for a guy who works on a garbage truck well but if the is where weeks and where thats 20 weeks desperation the friend went private 33 a colleague says they talked about control in a week he understood that it was about control if everything was growing together and here in 23 put the foot in what he called a friend  case so its not gypsum they said they were weeks and they gave the referral 13 thats a good question i understand that you are a doctor i will not describe it they took a picture they found a femoral fracture in they said that control should take place in a week and in dates for do you embrace or as usual health fund only for healthy people as the name suggests a friend broke his leg in his thigh while riding  on the board in they gave they gave a referral for control in the date of control in no one from the government and the is able to explain how it happened that the criminals were waiting for publication for almost three weeks doing because the term is still in progress and i am amused because this lady has just produced posters task made and is the pride of elites  what he does not perform anymore its a classic of the genre in time it just makes more fun and a bit of laughter will never hurt people will have a lot of fun reading this interview so about how performs tasks i recommend shipyards are liquidated done god is definitely not a woman otherwise there would be more commandments do not quarrel do not snore thats mean sexism  if you fire a bottle from the fire it escapes not the mouth applies to the neck seriousness is not matched with swallowing firecrackers this lord is known to me not only via in the human sense no in the light of the what kind of reaction can be expected from the show of ignorance that the police had once given  in and ended with a lynching i am pleased and greet you warmly deputy the bill could only be supported after the amendment of to the restrictive circle of addressees in we often ask was god then i do not know but he was certainly in the hearts of the the meeting begins  homage and prayer for those murdered at preparations for the commencement of the celebrations of the 69th anniversary of the of the of in the the parliamentary delegation of and sets off for the day celebrations delegation of and  she laid a wreath under a plaque commemorating the from who helped the of the opposition did not agree to the model of the system they want a fair state next a ball on the titanic i like when the singers on start to spit on me without arguments it strengthens me in the certainty that the absurd can not last forever 22 whats more she called a different claim called the lie of choice  and she won the trials we have courts and the ruling party 12 in the context of the hospital in i remind you that in the last campaign of the it claimed that commercialization is not a way to privatize "}]
