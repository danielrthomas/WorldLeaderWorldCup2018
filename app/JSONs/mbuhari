security of life and property is still top of our agenda we should draw encouragement from the series of conducted by last year which were generally and their outcomes adjudged to  be free and fair political discourse should be conducted with civility decorum and in a constitutional manner we all have a collective responsibility to strengthen our democracy and entrench the rule of law in this respect the rest of could learn from the states who have successfully internalized religion ethnicity and politics as the electioneering season approaches politicians must avoid exploiting ethnicity and religion by linking ethnicity with religion and religion with politics such must be avoided at all costs if we are to live in harmony i assure you that government is ever receptive to ideas which will improve governance and contribute to the peace and stability however there is a strong case for a closer look at the cost of government and for the public services long used to extravagance waste and  corruption to change for the better we must give a long period of trial and improvement before the system we have adopted is anywhere near fit for purpose we tried the system we jettisoned it now there are shrill cries for a return to the structure in older democracies these systems took centuries to evolve so we cannot expect a copied system to neatly fit our purposes we can be very impatient want to improve our conditions faster than may be possible considering our resources and capabilities when all the aggregates of nationwide opinions are considered my firm view is that our problems are more to do with process than structure no human law or edifice is perfect whatever structure we develop must periodically be perfected according to changing circumstances and the socioeconomic developments in respect  of political developments i have kept a close watch on the ongoing debate about restructuring great nations are built by enterprising people who turn their hands to anything that circumstances dictate by the same token i am today appealing to enterprising with ideas and unemployed graduates and other and literate men and women with ideas to not just sit and wait for employment from the government or the sector rice imports will stop this year rice fresher and more nutritious will be on our dishes from now on two years ago i appealed to people to go back to the land i am highly gratified that agriculture has picked up contributing to the governments effort to restructure the economy we have got to get used to discipline and direction in economic management the days of business as usual are  numbered diversification efforts have resulted in improved output particularly in agriculture and solid minerals sectors the relative exchange rate stability has improved manufacturing sector performance the government is slowly stabilizing the economy it was in order to change the steady and steep decline that we adopted the more sustainable policies and captured in the plan you will recall that it was not until last year that we got out of the economic recession into which the country had fallen as a consequence of past unsustainable economic policies which projected illusory growth these massive public works should spearhead the recovery and lead millions back to employment this is working with the distribution companies to overcome the continuing challenges of distribution  and the have added of 330 down to transformer capacity of 10 transmission stations of 132 down to transformer capacity of 42 substations including as i mentioned earlier the of can now distribute all the that can be generated with a financing commitment from the government of is targeted for 2023 the is at last taking off this project has been on the drawing

the from the course we have set ourselves our governments watch word and policy thrust is change i am determined to get to the root of this collective blackmail of all and ensure that whichever groups are behind this manipulated hardship will be prevented from doing so again the consequence was that not many could travel and the few who did had to pay exorbitant transport fares this is unacceptable

creating unnecessary fuel scarcity across the country unfortunately i am saddened to acknowledge that for many this and year holidays have been anything but merry and happy i join my fellow citizens

exploit every situation to frustrate the democratic process our country is going through difficult times in the hands of terrorists any act of violence can only complicate the security challenges but we must remain calm and peaceful while resolute do not allow yourself be tempted or provoked to violence as a and a candidate in the elections i share in the disappointment and  frustration at this

call on security agencies to promptly arrest and prosecute all those found guilty of violence in any form this is an urgent duty elections are not war politics is not a battle violence and hate speech by supporters of any of the candidates is not acceptable as i have continued to repeat at rallies and in the media it is our collective responsibility to ensure campaigns remain peaceful the only effective way to register our rejection of the present failure in governance is to vote peacefully and protect our votes peacefully good morning my friends as our message of continues to sweep around the country we reiterate our call against violence thank you we hope you have your though join the take a photo wear a and sign up to volunteer for change  on the campaign is a deeply inspiring one it is time for every one of us to decide us as we continue the relentless pace of our rallies in and today is finally here my friends we insist on a campaign of hope change and the future this election is about big important issues we refuse to play it small therefore i shall refuse to indulge the smear campaign i refuse to allow them take away the focus from the issues that concern you i am appealing to you the damage to this country is great the level of unemployment and insecurity is intolerable worsened by corruption let us focus on those issues please elections are not war 14 is not about politicians it is about our country imagine the accelerated growth we can now achieve in a democracy  the world has seen to be the most effective way of governing nations we are lucky to have in this election two people who have led this country i am proud to present our record of solutions and effectiveness we have presented our vision and plans through our manifesto available on and our town hall meetings we have only presented our record how we fought insurgencies how we the how we tackled corruption can our  president keep us safe when we travel to any part of this country is your life better today than it was six years ago do our children find it easy to get jobs do our sisters and brothers find it easy to set up and sustain their businesses we are concerned only about his record has he secured has he fought corruption has he truly grown the economy so it can work we have not spoken about the presidents family his health his religion his ethnic  group or his phone number we do not have a disinformation or propaganda wing in our campaign we have no need to waste time in driving petty attacks our president and his allies must remember that he is not only a candidate for office he is the president of we should be deeply worried that a president who called for calm during governorship elections has now lost his cool in his own elections where is his fabled calm where is his reserve where is his composure why is he so ruffled why is he so frustrated and afraid how can a president who has led this country for six years be unable to run on his own record and his achievements how can his campaign be talking about dead jogging around the stadium and outright lies about my health how can the president of this country be talking about remembering phone numbers and coup speeches all of us citizens and voters need to ask ourselves  why is our president so desperate what is this obsession with lies what is this obsession with pettiness what is this obsession with threats and attacks the desperation is beyond my understanding this campaign should be about those issues it should be about today and the future about securing lives and land the businesses of our enterprising youth are being killed by lack of access to finance and poor economic policies perhaps thousands of died in days ago our unemployment numbers are rising it is a tragedy to see the ruling party focus on pettiness and lies of cancer foreign treatment and certificates they know exist why should candidates tell so many frantic lies in order to win elections if truly their purpose is to  the lives of our people i have run for office before but i have consistently done so without desperation or anger because elections are not war i clearly underrated the panic and lack of integrity that leads people to tell barefaced lies and must confess it continues to confound me i have become seriously disturbed by the volume of falsehood and desperation from the opposition campaign of the morning my friends as we continue our relentless pace campaigning for change this week  reflect on the past few weeks shares a laugh with this morning after reading the tweets about we bring our urgent message of to you today may they never be forgotten may the of heroes past never ever be in vain god bless their families and god bless today we have nothing but gratitude for the

not politicians they deserve better we deserve better we must ask ourselves these questions how did we become like this how did we get to this point what kind of country have we become we cannot be the country that loses the essence of our humanity the meaning of empathy are dying everyday due to incompetence it is unacceptable to ignore or the deaths of citizens because of elections it is

people die because they were looking for jobs in and justice is not met several corruption scandals unsolved how can 219 girls be missing in our country and our leader appears incapable of action so let anyone blind you with fear so they can continue to plunder our resources and keep you away from  our common wealth and face the full wrath of the law as punishment for their crimes against our country as your president their punishment wont stop there we will also ensure and other such elements are found are arrested i have and will continue to condemn those who burn gods places of worship be they churches or mosques and wish gods judgment upon them even as of state we never imposed all my running mates  have been either or and always because they cannot attack our record they accuse us falsely of calling for election violence when we have only insisted on peace because they cant attack our record they accuse me falsely of ethnic jingoism they accuse me falsely of religious fundamentalism the world admired us we were proud to be we rebuilt industries queued up and treated each other with respect took pride in our reputation for discipline we forget so soon that there was ravaging the north east and we dealt with it we also overran the rebels in our government we fought corruption we the and we shut down insurgencies i have led this country and i have a record we were not perfect but we were effective we solved problems and we made proud people accuse me of many things but  one thing they never accuse me of is corruption they never accuse me of mediocrity or of lying are our parents safe when we leave them at home is the in your bank account of greater value today than it was four years ago can you honestly truly say to yourself that our country has changed for the better are our children safe when they go to school many people ask me why am i running for office again and i ask them what has changed since i began  this mission and nothing will change but
