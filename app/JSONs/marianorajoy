fall he has approved the largest package of measures to prevent and fight against corruption we toughen sanctions and controls and those who do not deserve to remain in them are no longer in our ranks my government never responded to calls we did not negotiate nor were there concessions its defeat is the result of the strength the determination and the democratic conviction of the we apply article

recovery we have reversed the economic situation in and now we are very close to reaching the record of security affiliation management is the brand we offered a great coalition to the as in to safeguard the general interest they rejected it today we know the true interest of its secretary general to preside over the government at any price he has always raised a stable constructive majority and that benefits the and unfair partners will not replace the will of citizens who endorse us at the polls we are facing a government with extreme weakness we do not know what is your program and not with the support that counts in practice it has only been an excuse to achieve their purposes with a trampled ambition they have not thought  neither in nor in the general interest today governs in

issues and most serious does not have the endorsement of the at the polls how can speak of stability when he intends to build the most unstable and weak government in the history of democracy its irrelevant to him what  important is to arrive motion your program is worth what your supports demand it is a pyrotechnic exercise in order to reach its goal to be president of the government even above the general interest this is irresponsible it is not in interest for to be president of the government his path leads to the ruin of the past to which they have already taken us the voted with enthusiasm against the it is no they said in order to reach the government is even able to govern with the budgets of the pp can anyone take it seriously talks about the bad  situation ignoring where we came from and the inheritance that they left behind today grows and creates more than 500000 jobs per year this motion censure knows no other motive than the efforts of it intends to amend the plan to the citizens in a persistent manner since 2015 he wants to arrive as he is and with whoever understand that many do not point to this the sentence is an excuse that serves  to hide the true intentions of to reach the presidency of the government without going through the polls because he knows that they will not endorse him what can offer better than a country that grows creates employment and has approved budgets so many are the urgencies of to subject to this blunder motion do you have any corrupt condemned in your ranks when the sentence of the arrives will you put yourself a motion of censure do not tease the censorship he has an immense majority of honest militants and therefore the voters have repeatedly given us their trust the left a country in ruins and others have restored welfare growth and employment  the interprets a sentence which is not firm in an interested and manipulated manner member of the government or any current militant of the lie in

government has been able to generate confidence credibility and recovery it is in the general interest to keep away from uncertainty and any element that is harmful to the presentation of this motion of censure is justified in a falsehood the sentence of  the is not firm it does not affect any member of the government it only concerns some events that took place in 2003 in and this motion of censure has no other objective than to be president of the government with whomever and at whatever price the lacks moral authority to present it in the week in which we have achieved support for the
