world is watching while disproportionately affects women and girls men and boys also number among the direct and indirect victims concerned that unless women can shape their own will turn a winter women women have fought daily wars not for but battles for to feed their children to make their presence felt we must send a message that  lives and votes and voices count and will be counted has a chilling effect on pol a long shadow of their access polling squares the aim is not only to protect women from it is to protect them to participate in public and economic life the has understood that there can be no security without security we also know that militarized mining can fuel  violations by enriching armed groups for instance in the in practice has recently been detected of natl sec forces renting out their uniforms civilians by facilitates rape is often perpetuated by incomplete disarmament and the absence of vetting training and security sector reform the proliferation of enable these atrocities as many women have told me man had the  had the is not a of human like disease or drought it is often planned and therefore predictable improved is therefore inextricably linked improved primary focus must always be needs rather than numbers to the blame shame and stigma most survivors still have more to lose than to gain from reporting rape the relationship of is like

seen how during war left a profound imprint a ceasefire does not mean peace for women if the shooting ceases but the rapes continue unchecked it is important not to exclude from consideration that continues  after the guns fall silent as a process of intimidation is often a precursor to conflict as well as the last weapon to be relinquished in its wake but when is driven by the dynamics of conflict is systematic constitutes a grave breach of isolated acts of rape occur in all times of war or crimes need to be addressed by the national machinery those who tolerate on notice that they do so in defiance of the its power enact enforcement a command structure with the capacity to sustain military operations and to punish deserters has the capacity to rein in acts of rape while not a panacea the list reminds perpetrators that they can no longer sleep easily at night under the cover of impunity and anonymity the message to armed groups is clear the point is to cease all acts of rape whether the  victim is 18 or 80 at its heart resolution 1960 is about prevention it creates for the first time a workable system of deterrence and accountability is not over when over better

era left by formal mechanisms from the to from to these crimes have been neglected at the peace table and stricken from the public record the report is also a historical record this is critical as the history of rape has been a history of denial the acts of sexual torture terror recorded here are not inevitable byproducts of war but crimes committed by commanders these reports are also vehicles for putting names to some of  complex horrors these reports do not just highlight horror stories they are a place to feature the stories of actions that have made a difference provides striking examples

solid foundation for a successful and sustainable future but we must not ignore the past or forget the survivors of sexual  violence in i understand that the country as a whole incl the government of

these reports of rape remain unconfirmed and even brutally silenced they have arrested the attention of the world despite robust action by the international community to protect  civilians in we still hear reports of sexual violence the number of reported violations is therefore just the tip of the iceberg of actual incidents most cases of sexual violence go underreported due to shame stigma fear
