thats a good thing a dumb party is usually a dumb one creating opportunities for those who come those who live here integration plan interesting comparison in the first case too little changes in changes when people know that they can safely come to through contingents they do not have to trust themselves to smugglers should absorb contingents of refugees as it has done in other civil war conflicts is saying goodbye today to a great statesman the from a big thank you my generation is in prosperity peace  grew up today one thinks in which world the own children grow up today i expressed my sympathy with my family in for president we are on the side of we need a fresh start in refugee policy my guest contribution with foreign minister companies are the of the world now they have to become the of the industry too our goal must actually be to have the best digital infrastructure in the world by 2025 in our art and cultural landscape stands for our free open society we will always defend it against attacks it is no coincidence that the terrorists have again sought cultural goals they reject our culture we will not allow the victims in  are being abused to make policy against refugees the wrong sentence of these days is after everything is different after nothing can be different we stand by the free society we will not divulge the free state and the open society but our values resolutely the killers meant us all they attacked all of our values  of freedom openness the rule of law democracy i am deeply shaken our hearts and thoughts are with our friends during these difficult hours integration demographics need longterm funding funds for social housing daycare centers and schools for all we mourn the loss of and are proud that he was one of us his judgment and his advice will be missed today commemorating his principle of confidence and realism must be the benchmark of politics even today in the refugee crisis we do not accept refugees to solve demographic problems it is our duty is the next challenge i was just at the demographic congress immigration migration also play a major role in the demographic development the has prevailed  zones are off the table no detention no fence early education benefits the children the parents the business the society invested is worth it i was the first minister of economics at to talk about early education unfortunately a little later because i brought my daughter to as the new secretary general of the proposed she is a convinced and convincing democrat it is an impertinence for the to contribute with the symbol policy of transit zones to help understand each other again zones are unsuitable for the entry procedures of refugees they are neither organizationally feasible nor legally feasible the dispute between threatens the governments ability to act this mutual blackmail is unworthy and irresponsible award of the prize  to the a strong sign of freedom of expression and of the press worldwide my yesterdays interview with the in full length can be found here the has accompanied me today and others to the radicalization in parts society who wants to experience industry 40 must drive to not to i was here today with congratulations to for election to the 1st chairman the will continue to stand by your side as a reliable partner was awarded the her themes also shaped life for a long time it was just indecent what and are doing now it gets dangerous must right arsonists in the barriers  point has no place in the political debate my thoughts are with the victims of the attack in their relatives in the campaign final spurt is the best decision for to go talked about what social democratic solutions to the refugee crisis in can look like i just met with chairman of the are responsible for their children now also applies to the dismantling of in integration and in social infrastructure would cost us dearly rising incomes due to the introduction of minimum wages and pension policies are creating strong domestic demand despite a slight reduction in the prognosis the  economy continues to grow this is due to the positive development of employment is the basis for prosperity and employment of the is working program i have just honored for 25 years of motto i like say what you do do what you say thanks to all participants in the fun should we do it more often  do but not necessarily with confidence and realism the keeps the country together in difficult times the in starts right away we are looking for strong for forward to the discussions on the sidelines of the party for in i meet with and nice people we live in political times how do we want to design these together we will find answers tomorrow at the on congratulations to the on the sign of democracy freedom especially in these times we need honest discussion about realistic solutions to the refugee crisis my contribution with such commitment offers trolls and hate comments thank you  for this more of that a question of solidarity what can do in the refugee crisis must do my commentary with today is also my personal happily married to a woman who comes from visit the center of which looks back on 120 years of tradition in in visit my party friend who wants to become prime minister in yesterday at the stressed transition also means reduce power consumption efficiency is a basic condition of the energy transition topics were similar to we talked among others on refugees the balancing act between family and job in the i answered 80 questions in one hour  vis it was a little less a good punchline is better than a bad world with loses one of its most brilliant voices our culture of living together is in art 120 of the why i let it print in you sorry that i could not answer everything but promised well make it faster again than in years so now i have to go home my daughter is sick only fever but thats more important than politics and even as twitter it depends because people should decide how they want to live and not how they supposedly live energy from for example i hope we are more prudent  to visions guy i hope that clears up quickly the 600000 workers are not allowed to pay for their managers mistakes am to work on negotiations by exactly what works for its not without incentives and a broad purchasing offensive on all levels of government that quitting always acts as if it is about supply or demand policy both are necessary yes but above all people must be allowed to say their fears otherwise the rights of the fears make use of change by has long happened but not  everything was right for example lacked the minimum wage pact of infrastructure via digitization to education already happened plus 58 billion for energy efficiency yes but the truth is super complicated and will take a long time  because it does not make any numbers against each other but good would be arguments they always knew that democracy and socialism should not be opposites where did we slow down yes yes in this legislature with my daughters pooh question that would be speculation and helps us today unfortunately nothing more still we do not at all and if then certainly not in social benefits or education best school of politics and the highest municipal relief by the in the federal government is doing it and after our intervention the too but always  still too little at my age when it finally succeeds in ending the wretched tax dumping in decentralized as possible as much central as necessary at the minimum wage is nothing changed otherwise refugees will be played against domestic workers there is quite a lot of information about it first the hearings come i can not do it on all afternoons 23 always otherwise in trouble with my wife professions are underpaid we must be prepared to increase care contributions for this  the new chief does not have his slogans no but the private arbitration courts from all the free trade agreements that we have got out that has two reasons the legislation of the last legislature and the overproduction in morning back with her the best day of every week yes but there is currently no guaranteed majority in many countries nevertheless it could be true that it is in the face of the parties in which you have a drop out not only at the parties is since you can see how economical the office equipment of a deputy is because it means serious offenses subject to a judges decision also by  because there is no willingness to contingents in the refuses to set quotas for it if he is not he must be i would not understand anything else thats what been doing since i was in office the war in and because then more talk and less is said the question i do not understand this is exactly what we have decided last week 500 million annually that there are obviously other ways than the because we coped well with it also on our feet and for 152 years at the normal people eyes on minimum wage  billion more for kindergarten and education pension after 45 etc etc yes but not only there the worst is currently in nursing jobs because poorly paid i went there to protest and stopped the tank deliveries finances are a prerequisite for coping with crises thats just what we see at whether its gay or straight because of freedom equality and solidarity should try whether it succeeds but is open must be more in negotiations how she did it is causing us problems today the exit plan until 202122 was better in a series of  governed countries the suffrage applies from 16 no but changing that requires majorities not only in why we have to work its the only chance to inspire falls in love with me so sorry i hope it definitely yes but in the election parties were elected which unfortunately do not want only promise what you can hold but party and political bashing should not be an excuse more direct participation of members and also of interested and sympathizers the only solution is the ending of the wars for the people in there  of course question in a democracy everyone has the chance to win what do they do i hope that i find time to make it more frequent again the demands this again and again from the but they refuse so far asylum seekers are allowed since 18 work has the enforced in which we do not allow performance cuts also housing for all and not just for refugees nothing but if fulfills the agreement the sanctions will have to fall gradually i honestly say that we do what do you suggest question  answer i have no idea about that i have to be smart first sorry we need freedom of choice for mothers and seek an agreement between health insurance midwives its never about the middle but about the working center of society just participation in having interpreters are important but we will also need cultural interpreters its a chance to involve already living here should not become a projection screen for other social problems therefore we have to socially promote housing for all we must not forget anyone not the refugees but not the other people in at the meeting with representatives of the organizations involved in the refugee crisis i pointed out we  must stick together at the economic reception of the faction i have just campaigned for a modernization pact we have to promote innovation to massive technical problems we had to cancel the announced chat for today well catch up with him as soon as possible i have answered a few frequently asked questions about the wants to fight tax fraud to prevent this is not scared even before blackmail attempt is manager of the tax evader behind extortion attempt has talked about the future of on the past one of many differences respect for hard work of that we need more a few days ago i already have that with  asked is actually still for nuclear power by the way 95 of the population are not affected by the tax concept for families benefit from abolition fees rarely heard as absurd tax propaganda as by even in the are there really continue to increase more money for education reduce debt and reduce taxes at the same time has taken care in school knows he does not go jolly that just before state elections the upset over the financial equalization who himself have negotiated tip if wants to know how to support the municipalities he should look at the program i can not help me a real sympathy is not yes only a few days left at the bottom of schools this will be as prime minister  change is right school must be organized with a view of the child not the doorbell have my campaign appearances behind me for today what about tax fraud and dumping the explains if you want to know how to deal successfully with tax evasion banks look in credit is a crime why does he want to legalize this with the tax treaty moderator asks about campaign tolerance for tax fraud here it is i have not changed the impression i have also has obviously no interest in content i suspect the people in see this a little differently clear announcement from basis for a book with  or has shown ironic emotions in an ironic photo interview was also so good in because he listens to people at events good election campaign is conversation just for comparison who can only come to a conclusion in actual election vote so chancellor the man must be chancellor right there must be a lot more talk about vocational education for nursing professions there are only warm words from the there are also more money from the best relief program for fees abolish equal pay for equal work for women and men is part of peers 100 the is currently fighting for nonvoters and undecideds who is not to vote  leaves lets others decide for themselves is not a minimum wage if you work you have to be able to live on it without a stocking up nothing promises nothing he can not keep also a decisive difference compared to we finally need the taxation of the financial markets cause of the crisis must be involved in costs after election campaign in now makes great congratulations that was a sovereign great performance disadvantages must be deselected i find it pleasant that and deal fairly and without ripples was of course better we have the highest tax revenue ever why then does his 110 billion new debt brazen  explains that is responsible for disaster why is nobody laughing looking forward to the tough questions about is of the you can tell wants to own way at energy transition roundabout for all is not the involved in this chaos bridge is right have to lower electricity tax have blocked is actually still for nuclear power plants anyone who oversleeps the topic of childcare for years can sway of dynamics if he even lolls only once who wants to do what for families should abolish fees like the speaks of freedom of choice does it work if there is no day care now family policy has today devastating family splitting of  issued by the way says precisely how it wants to finance traffic investments without bubbles is right with car toll either all motorists would ripped off or it is one of the typical bubbles at 2015 its off looking forward to the the bet is does not keep his promise to the pensioners in the fight against poverty must resign seems to have won a fight congratulations however is really no equal opponent see in my is the stone bridge of the small parties clear precise i want to coalesce with that fight join the same committed campaigners at the summer festival disadvantage can not watch live as the wins survey says  has clearly won i think its true but you at the reception of in the peer you are a cool pig has brought the topics clearly to the point and has also remained relaxed appearance of him i already knew it before we have a great candidate clear point victory he has set the topics would have to react black yellow did not start particularly refreshing for that stop soon 21 days what should i choose now of course me very good clear announcement from act as chancellor only on the basis of a mandate in international law in shows great understanding for completely different data protection laws in the and its about fundamental rights rashes  there is freedom of choice for parents only with instead of with care money in care and health clear announcement from is is now acting at after years also there clear announcement from talks about the energy turnaround in her government ministers quarrel pure anarchy prevails is working on a pension concept thats a joke right wow even in such a stressful situation peer shows wit and has 21 days left that sits talks more but says less clear plea from to combat tax fraud does nothing plain text by peer we have banking crisis in so we have to put financial markets on the chain  that does not want also on the subject of clear precise and honest peer asks the better questions as expected does not manage to give clear answers to clear questions wants to cut taxes spend more and reduce debt why does not she ask any of the presenters what she had in math very good makes clear that wage floor brings nothing to millions of people says everyone should be able to live from their work why is she then against the minimum wage makes clear in the first few minutes what he will do differently as then looking forward to the we look together with many supporters in to solution is in has to convince that his policy is fatal  consequences we must not make the mistake of following exclusively military logic in if does not draw any consequences from the scandalous handling of must deal with it important note to all 229 vote in the with the first vote he is great i am proud of my this great poster can be signed right away on the debates arena by the creator anyone who is interested in society using social justice has lost a clever fellow campaigner why i invited from the to an internship i do not want data capitalism or an omniscient data state  so in my new territory i usually feel quite well the alternatives are clear or or whatever the economy of justice or the economy of the casino the current development in is a disaster more in my interview with knows no bounds in election pledge she would probably promise the dissolution of the was nominated in open primaries of citizens as district candidate today he won the election response to the speech of to 2009 promised gt 20 billion  cuts now 2013 gt 20 billion wants to sell the for the second time for stupid instead of incidentals the must negotiate the chapter on the rule of law chapter with that helps against violence first massively drive id recession now they explain the to the restructuring case the perpetrators shout stop the thief foreign policy this is the theory of the reality tanks at dictatorships it is ashamed for this government leads into recession only saving is not enough your fasting cure becomes anorexia stop sorrowing what the may 1945 has to tell us today explains in just 12 minutes calls tax fraud antisocial right the true asocial are the ones who  take everything with what has to offer but tax fraud commit would have bicycle chain finally i know why i was a pop representative of the not to ban the means allow them to continue with their taxpayers racist propaganda can finance day more women for mens jobs motivate is the womens jobs finally better to pay at least as well threatened and of the and elites trample on bourgeois values not is the problem but the system bankruptcy business models of banks tax dumping governments that stand by today again women quota on supervisory boards in the there are just no women of the format more same  he took the liberal block party of the id on which previously pursued the in the citizen participation the leaves in primaries gt thousands of citizens decide who will be their district candidate we and the have wanted it for decades only now do hopefully with today the determination on is abandoned afterwards the experts are off to compare different locations today after 30 years of dispute chance of agreement new search for the most suitable storage for nuclear waste instead arbitrariness in tax evasion and punish sharper who is for it can sign here hypocrisy just wanted legalize tax fraud through the agreement today they are outraged that there is something like that  when it comes to a symbolic act there will be today the clearly rejected motion for resolution government and large parts of the bourgeois successor parties of are missing in the honoring of president holds commemorative speech for and the for their rejection of the enabling act 80 years ago i do that myself but thats why i do not do it that often i do not always have time we vote against but its not a consent but just an opposition act thats why the can not stop it we vote against it but you should look into the then you would know that the can not stop the but on such a day its worth pointing out we say no to the but can not stop the into the constitution  facilitates legal knowledge are we but the can not stop the but here in the net the constitution does not seem to be very well known a look at the constitution would show you that not stop the in the today is the day of the water a good day to be against the privatization of drinking water supply in the interior minister wants to save from unchristian to sort refugees by religion idea but the general election is in the summer but the expropriation of retail investors to spare the big ones is rather of course is supposed to be a part of it but please the big investors who have earned the adventurous financial system of if that is so  stood it is nonsense the alternative has been clear for three years a banking insolvency law separation banks and a liability fund of the big banks had to buy me new ones why to criticize the expropriation of small savers and the breaking of law is not a mud fight election campaign is for me the democratic competition for ideas and the results of practical government action our proposals have been on the table since the 200809 financial crisis has implemented practically nothing i am for separation banks for a liability fund of the big banks instead of constantly asking the taxpayers to checkout first protect millions of tax evaders and now expropriate small savers today and tomorrow congratulations to new now 12 of  16 state capitals governed by social democracy must come to all heres my interview at directly with at to the sun to freedom 150 years of the an exciting wonderful evening their comprehensive application against the privatization of drinking water consented only to the much too weak application of the left not you too i have already answered we say no to that the citizens have written today in the program i was until yesterday in the can only assume that it was the concrete text read it that were written to us exactly the planned new fee is wrong because of the consequences for the organizers but the itself not the  sinking electricity prices of the stock exchange are not passed on and the federal government has failed the reform of the prejudices wrap up proposals also appear as such in the election program the only declares that they should implement them thats exactly what we want to achieve just like today the future of the must look from bottom to top the is against the privatization of the drinking water supply thats what citizens write about today in our election program statement in the break of the why is having such a hard time with dual citizenship i already wrote at random and 50 men women the only selection criterion no membership experts was also in quotation marks  we want to rule with the and not with the so that as much as possible or much remains the total of 300 150 members 150 nonmembers of the are randomly selected from the 40000 the concrete examples are here until this evening until worked out then land in the program may have citizens have ideas but in the end decide only experts the program citizens ideas are part of the program here meets the of the future people from write with the election program 150 nonmembers and 150 members is but it works here bin bin back from an incredibly diverse country  is work that you can live on and with which you can live we also need a new purchase for the humanization of the working world has died a great person a great personages in journalism sad hours for all who knew her submitted commentary by on the poor poverty report of the government minimum wage prosperity for all was once the credo of the social market economy today it is apparently for a few the  private assets in are distributed very unevenly such truths can not fake away even black and yellow poverty report it is about the dignity of work is not what creates work but what creates work that you can live on congratulations to the new prime minister of the on his election voted in the first ballot one billion rising our at the reception violence against women worldwide reception at we show the film about the conflict movie night at the with cultural politician success of the is human rights million votes against now must current survey the people feel  apparently with whom just family policy is best repealed chancellery becomes a counterfeiting workshop my comment on the poverty report of the government in the respect for the resignation of a clever and decent colleague back remains remnant ramp interesting what the newest member of best government on tuition fees today press conference on 150 years of social rise and fight for more justice more at reading interview with on version it is no longer about denying mistakes of the past but rather not continuing them accepted  often you do not have to write to people like you and be sure i leave such answers to no interns wants to score after years shortly before the election with in the evening the lazy become busy premiere with popcorn the board at the film in cinema no matter what ms is accused what writes today in is vicious misogynist where is the protest the wait was worth it congratulations to and his team the evening shows every voice for left and pirates is a lost voice if you want to change direction you have to choose or greens the has increased the lost and at the you can see they are actually only with is not there thanks to and to the comrades and comrades in  lower for this enormously dedicated and great election campaign you can choose in and on the way to the polling station tell your neighbors how important the change with is in the evenings lazy people become diligent years are blocked the in equal pay of women men in the election year she discovers the topic for waste is also the nuclear no to the nuclear waste export and no to the corresponding law the state must keep influence on infrastructure the power grids show what happens when the influence is missing no to privatization wants to privatize rail only in years  make new debt now spoil the policy a la readers know more that was once instead of fact check to the pension policy only propaganda check all numbers come from the here is the answer there was a sign language interpreter like every party convention and for you a nonsense its about what makes a party who for example like introduces care money does not need to rant about more education sustainability freedom scope do not restrict future generations the motto of the day in health education work for everyone would be good for the election program at just 20 degrees  in always in a good mood true true good that there is what happened in your head because bad i did not count but even if it was the 20th it would be right yes certainly not well do our very best in any case stupid cynicism has never brought humanity any further first it was there and secondly the were also there today 140 characters i can not reflect days debate but it was and is exciting yes but better late than not at all and its not that easy we met today in for the first time next meeting 22 may in no they will not come together with and next time  the progressive alliance besides the of are also the congress the and so on progressive alliance wants capitalism 21st century international than 42 parties work together since today today we have over 40 parties from all continents founded a new international in the progressive alliance if the courts decide that way thats why i just declared it gas extraction by injecting highly toxic chemicals into the ground in wanted to lower today in the environmental standards for but they have failed at countries welcome to the on theme our social fair democratic with moon numbers discredit the pension concept  the truth is we want to invest in the cohesion of our society the discredit with invented numbers pension concept difference to the we invest in social not people finally want to talk about politics declares his election campaign goals to the party convention was there a typo in the question or was that meant seriously so you can only talk if you are rich or have no idea we will take care of that but that alone is not enough and because we can not unfortunately reschedule on the green field and a change constitution with 23 is not in sight therefore we do not want the grand coalition but the is the only closed party  concept and present it because the task of todays and for many years current age of 63 would be invaluable for a pension access that would not help do you have to make it on a deadline for all since training times unemployment counts there are millions who profit from the regulation yes but humming now helps nothing you have to do something yes i know from my own family it is miserable how little we appreciate the nursing professions in unemployment not numbers for people like you for 150 years probably nothing the truth is study does not count to the insurance period academics can expect the pension  abandonment of contribution cuts later erratic rise better building a sustainability reserve in which one does not pointlessly now lowers the contributions in order to increase them later abruptly now a sustainability reserve build up times of the unemployment and times of the child education are insurance periods likewise the time of the training training times and periods of unemployment are included the is cynical 30 cents per working year at the end 10  about social assistance we want solidarity with at least 850 45th regulation is important for very stressful professions pensions at 67 otherwise work like pension cuts because many do not even make it to 65 today the will realign its pension policy after 45 years of insurance everyone should be able to retire without any deductions from 63 onwards makes tax reduction as a gift to the dilapidated at the expense of the municipalities its paid  with higher fees we say no the has stopped the tax evasion relief law of in the of tax evasion is antisocial certainly not but if someone in the calls a racist not silent on that you have to go to twitter the truth remains the referred to someone who wanted to prevent me from talking loud raids throughout tax criminals sleep badly thats good news not anymore must go back to the session yes of course whoever works should not have to go begging for social services afterwards therefore play after 45 years contribution periods including training plus periods of unemployment raising children  correct the answer is clear no lowering of the pension insurance contribution now but building a sustainability reserve even so you are not yet on the safe side therefore solidarity is important even with a minimum wage of course it will be much more the question is rather with what profession do you compare deputies no more the system has nothing to do with machines but with people not at all the system before separation of social welfare was cynical today we give about billion  more than before pensions have nothing to do with inflation but they depend on wages rounds must balance the inflation rate unfortunately its not thats it ask them tiles what he thinks of our regulation 45th for such jobs it would be a salvation it depends on how long my voters choose me at home id and how long i run for it we do our best today there are many who land despite work in retirement in the social welfare that is much less and we want to prevent that may be that you do not care about the topic not others the other topics are however no but they give those who worked a significantly higher pension than those who did not work the pay system  is the best but like earlier it will not because earlier there were more children but more pensioners we want the pension after 45 years teaching from age 18 means pension with 63 pension cut prevented in 2009 if you have worked for a long time you must get at least 850 solidarity that helps 125000 pensioners year 75 of them women and 23 in the those who are against poverty must raise wages is of poverty therefore minimum wage  equal pay same work does not work life benefits pension is what fr

gave a brilliant speech no technocratic talk but a departure to a socially just with opportunities for all defines as technology talent and tolerance i think is more the connection between freedom and responsibility talks about the future of in a technocrat gibberish in which no one knows where the journey is supposed to go to only months of boisterous action by her government to bully out of the today 180 turnaround statement prize for a credible representative of democratic should  to receive him the president energy transition plan is a revelation no law only cornerstones of troupe the bill pays the electricity customer more transparency for members who is for this can sign here that in subsidiary has to strike for 850 is a scandal a shame for the savings bank organization at the savings bank subsidiary  has been on strike for 88 days after 15 years to get the first wage increase to 850 interesting article on copyright pirates ultimately it is the in new guise war grade at the freshman in the of young market introduction program no clarity on future infrastructure  for electric cars this so important industrial project will fail industrial policy in electric cars has failed because in this federal government no one cares consistently about a topic failure in the industrial policy of instead of as promised million electric cars in 2020 there will probably only a few thousand today the party committee unanimously nominated as chancellor candidate there was no power struggle taming the financial markets new social balance but is the best chancellor candidate needs a new social balance this includes a fair tax system taming the the stands for tough control our goal is a society in good prosperity this  prosperity must be fairly distributed work needs good pay again good debate in the faction its not just about poverty but also about youth poverty poverty and family poverty the listens start today for the tomorrow we continue chat live stream to on from 15 clock live from the send suggestions questions already or in the chat shows needs new social balance top tax rate up property tax on education financing ignores poverty report wants to fake him right away note reality can neither be ignored nor adjusted by the government we are listening heres the new video on the citizen what needs to get better in we are listening from at the  on and in your area the report of shows we have to tax high and highest incomes and wealth more who wants to know against whom and for what the fights heres my speech yesterday at the winter thanks for the hint the hour is want to return to the thank you for joining because it would be even more difficult for low outside the but the right thing would be citizens insurance for all no the pension also the solidarity must reward life achievement and solidarity contribution payment the honest answer is that the minister of was unable and willing to do more than that at the time it is unfair no these sayings of pension at 70 ignore the  many workers who wants it voluntarily it may yes yes we absolutely need that decreasing number contributor more and more pensioners the bill wants the load generations well then get well soon without obligatory own insurance yes for officials see the answers above in the countries there are always compulsory occupational pensions which depend on the income level therefore a change would currently also involve significant costs in 40 to 50 years it will pay off take up work subject to social security if possible build a private preferably company retirement provision educational times are taken into account in addition pension according to minimum income employment benefit  of it especially we try it anyway rising insurance premiums people are more at risk for the solidarity idea storm drought at federal level the sustainability factor from the pension insurance has been transferred to civil servants pensions in the same way the money is not enough as the thinks for both better reduction in earning capacity security level of 50 the says faster increase to 22 pension contribution we want to do that too because we are improving the disability pension of course because today they are paying the subsidy anyway it is not as today full on baby food and half on dog food because social justice is systemically important for democracy today at  congress the abolition vocational civil service brings a lot of savings in the future pensions but today also costs a lot not only for the journalists also for me nix is with lunch break you have to ask the flexible transitions for those who do not manage it already today due to the workload to work until 65 low is the wage that compels people despite work to become social services temporary work should it go without responsibility of the generations for each other who does not want that is a merciless egoist one of the most important questions one idea is to have government inspectors from civil society that sounds great for those who can afford it yes  but not today in this twitter interview we wanted that already in 1998 in the were against now has the majority there missing only in the nothing not constantly and everywhere i can not admit that publicly but you see unfortunately when or with me the room for maneuver for the employees increases but also because pay negotiation means inflation and productivity only courage therefore the core in must remain the statutory pension the supplementary capital cover must be regulated no we think more about as soon as i am no longer elected or my wife no longer joins in or i have no desire to answer such questions  a special tariff system in the flexible contributions in case of precarious and bad the no i would rather do that under a government because then we are sure that we will enforce it yes but it has to be more regulated and controlled and best of all in the context of income development solidarity is a type of basic pension it is much higher for those who have paid contributions into the we want to work for the self employed without self protection legal system to develop a suitable tariff flexible contribution payment with is that it gets after also a training place and not only a measure tun we do not we agree  but we also want to help those who can not manage to work until 65 more than difficult because they do not want to talk about minimum wage poverty poverty or flexible transitions each time a different one from our great reservoir we are discussing with the unions and are not finished yet but in the end everything has to be affordable coffee ready vitamins at hand lets go on the pension concept the plaintiffs have great confidence in the this is important for the political culture in the fact that so many citizens have joined the lawsuit shows that people are not indifferent to our community only if we stabilize will remain stable and thats what the is all about  verdict is good news for millions of workers in whose jobs depend on exports anyone who has questions about the pension concept of the next 12 to 13 clock the discussion on the pension concept of the is opened here is what its all about anyone who talks about poverty must not be silent about poverty therefore no agreement on the pension with without legal minimum wage the party leader is right calls in the interview more solidarity among and countries unbelievable swiss banks move black money tax criminal to reveals the now has understood the has just not good negotiated enough at the tax treaty secret bonds  in an interview with the abolition property tax was a mistake right he has it is also in the law we will introduce them again facade democracy start of the program debate 2013 exclusively in the and start program debate for 2013 in the your call in the text i have asked the philosopher to formulate his demands for an policy the result system an exposing article about written by a confessing conservative in the what do and have in common in addition my todays contribution in the world banking crisis present of boss  after my now he lacks a few cups in the closet has government really implemented the decisions on financial market regulation no the default list so now most of the questions from yesterday have to be answered if something is missing well repeat the action soon therefore you have to take this opportunity of course not lets face it it was the prevailing opinion starting in the it does not help you will have to try it because without us there will be no policy change i think the is still an unfortunately necessary instrument of crisis management only too late too hesitant thats a great idea hardly people have different  of social origin the state should ensure that all still have equal opportunities it who was with this slogan thousands of persecuted and murdered shareholders and major customers are also heavily involved nevertheless that is too little our goal banks must be able to go bankrupt this case shows that meanwhile the methods of mafia combat must be used to bring light into the darkness yes every government and every parliament needs significantly more initiatives for lobby control thats what they have to ask those who do that at the moment they are finding what they are looking for at the and hotel tax pharmaceutical rights etc we had to struggle for years until agreed to negotiate in that happens now we only live well when others are so happy that they are ours  because 45 helped us much more by account opening at the i have just made the proposal for banking regulation see just as then education research rule of law security infrastructure culture security in old age or disease we raise taxes for that we try by threatening banks with criminal prosecution we should do that too see tax code no but apparently the big banks can not and thats the only point be but then states do not have to pay any more debts to save them that saves much more money trying it today as far as it was not rhetorical questions because they are ad ruling  holds months only connection without content judicial reservation prosecution of serious crime the burden balancing today must take place over the taxation of the financial markets for 150 years the dares people ability to too without there would be neither in that does not do it since its establishment 150 years ago the wants the life of single free be open not very much for 40 years the federal government has have made policies at the expense of the municipalities that needs to change in the past the were also smarter in their attacks on the there is no way over and the is already doing a lot some say too much yes thats true unfortunately but you have to take life as it is but you can  do not leave it like that because we have 80 million inhabitants and a much more complex economy try our very best among other things do not conceal mistakes tie rescue to banking regulation fairer tax system same salary for equal work beautiful saying but not more she is not it lacks time and action plan network expansion expansion etc a new creates wants this government not only the trying it grad a good thing nobody wants us therefore one must finally come back to that banks can go bankrupt for this they have to shrink and adhere to themselves because the parliament according to our constitution  responsible is but the right to referendums must be in the i hope it stays that way one does not want to be associated with everyone just to recalculate the nuclear energy share was 28 percent and not 90 thats fabulous nonsense although i do not know what one has to do with the other in case of doubt we do not want to be chosen by everyone if agrees the city will have to give way in the end amp if toxic transactions run only there synonymous no problem quite even without twitter see my voters constituency in the electoral district for 22 years as easy as you otherwise do it only and in dealing on the topic why not you can twitter every day  i agree thats why we want to win the majority in 2013 as well otherwise you can not act at the moment we are being expropriated by the banking sector whose loss socialism we are paying he was as was the case with the vast majority of the public apart from the media and economists first i grew up there too and second thats why i want to get the garbage out of there well now you have given it to me right this is bonsai economy without debt no investment the question is how much for what yes and a few successes for would be even better but still coming not my experience this direct contact makes politics exciting and successful politics is as well as the public  too long market ideologists have run after in economics media if interest rates reflect data of the respective economy no problem today they are the result of speculation and is hungry bye until next time to more time so many thanks to all who have participated also to the conspiracy theorists now the coffee is all at its core is that risk and liability again in one hand not like today loss socialism they make so many which do you mean but in principle good it started in the and we thought at some point we would have to join in we have learned others not yes strange process party books sometimes have  not always something to do with interests and banks are all about interests its our only chance to have a voice in the 21st century world alone we have none with the of lending and temporary work equal pay for equal work following the election of the proposals for banking regulation were discontinued in the history of the there were more powerful and worse opponents yes but if the legal framework allows irresponsible action there will always be people who try it thats it yes he was always one of those who wanted more liberalization nix is than conspiracy theories  you do not have to make an effort can always complain about the evil world i think well do it but i will vote against the complete ban not enough the is not taxed that would be quite nonsense thats not necessary it is important that they stick with their equity capital not savers and taxpayers would be a real strong banking decisive are the rules by which the works banks have acted irresponsibly thats why sector regulate the politics if is chief advisor to that has to do with left nothing to do on a missing why must  you ask because our proposals have been available since 2009 you are we wanted to do it this week and this weekend i have no time so more direct than now its not it would be nice if you were right why should savers with deposits for risks in investment banking be liable is a rental apartment if 27 at the same time by is being pushed for saving a recession is the consequence of a pressure from to liberalize had unfortunately also in politics effect have defended them 20 years against the attacks of the also they need rules of the game increasing transparency in balance sheets also  check for financial market products and deductible increase thats just what getting so alone for 150 years shows this saying has always helped only the rulers you will hardly find a statement from me in the last three years in which it did not matter to that i personally appreciate her too much your prejudices will play a trick on you be brave but for reassurance that belongs to my wife it is rather negligence when shopping i promise improvement because the debate makes no sense and does not solve the problem sometimes i do not go to because sometimes i need the 140 characters as text question  for an export nation like it makes a lot of sense is the winner of the 575 billion we have taken more than spent it is just always just her to say with this one can be so nice to cultivate policy bias helps it does nothing after the 2009 general election co not worked on it why not you have to ask 2009 is all about banking regulation  at 20 in at the suggestion of been decided and look worth it nope normal phone photo that a colleague has just made by me in the apartment in no but in already therefore it may also go in the policy to banking regulation and what does this saying help you nix is because we too thought we had to give in to the pressure of the financial markets in order to keep attractive as an investment location anyone who thinks they can do without the rescue parcels has no idea how high the costs and unemployment will be would yes because the crisis needed solutions right from the start but they are coming now after more than years good that you see that and not  want to run against her frankly i do not know but check it out i do not believe i think is fed the coffee is here so lets start of the is my 10 000th follower welcome and thank you for the interest the 100 000th gets a gift from me regulate banking power tomorrow 1011 am i sit down to the on the laptop to answer your questions i really thought we would have the topic now through try it since we have to prefer them now we are looking for a new date we will certainly have to prefer that now ill do both gladly i greet you back also  just like this so i like to support the members request even if i disagree with the content we do our very best is nice if you can maintain his prejudices now on twitter right come to the party i invite you to the is nothing in secret even then not when it would be better so it started with many anytime like we must again learn to argue constructively in the members appeal against i am happy despite a different opinion to an open debate pro contra on co have been trying to cram a suffrage in their favor by 3000 citizens the stopped that at the evasion generates poverty according to are up to 32 trillion worldwide  on black accounts tax treaty with protects rich tax criminals says finance minister on thank you do we need stricter rules to tame the banking and financial sector here you can vote and above all a financial market which subordinate again politics and democracy the common good and it was who was the first one in 2008 to admonish the predatory capitalism and the banks undifferentiated here are a few additions to my page thats why we can not care less about a looming financial crash in it also endangers the economy keep it up if you are market conformer  democracy give more credence then condolences because 140 characters are not enough here my not so stupid answers to the is working diligently to disqualify itself as a partner for any other party so no in it is about acute more at my page because 140 characters are not enough here are the answers to your questions on my page crisis to read here are my theses on regulation of the banking and financial sector for business practices not only of the acutely affected banks the term is rather harmless bankers endanger economics and democracy on irresponsibility  financial markets you can really congratulate only on your ability to optimally hide your education i think saving savings is a legitimate goal no but because the prosecutors are hopelessly inferior therefore focus public prosecutors create yes of course but that too has to be finally a post that helps third crisis management is not wrong and unnecessary because it does not mean a crisis solution firstly i do not have to give myself anywhere secondly i call for a return to the social market economy system and to keep your savings we do it all no because the without common financial fiscal and economic policy  was created that catch up and now dramatically i do not understand the tweet for this to happen theres the debt brake in the debt in the crisis is allowed if it is paid off in the upswing yes thats the real problem but that does not have to stay that way no i made during the session when the speeches were repeated so they defame themselves only courage yes i am of the opinion that some belong there but decide the is a thank you only courts maybe i read from i certainly do not but political questions are they are usually not digital in mode to answer we agree on that  worthless pragmatism is just as wrong as priceless discourse on value moral acting for practical purposes i do not suppress that but i answered the question of what was done in 2009 because in unfortunately nobody dares to the separation of investment and commercial banks yes is it well because the state remains solvent i also do not consider these votes to be a mistake and politics is something else than thats not what its all about it is about the impact of bank insolvency on other banks and on the real economy what i think is right does not matter in this case the case law sees it differently than you  only and only for that reason do we make the rescue measures otherwise your savings and checking accounts will soon be empty but on the contrary growth must be financed therefore better spending and taxation of the financial markets also helped in your life to make something of your life and for all that the state levies taxes nobody works out everything alone schools the rule of law infrastructure social peace homeland security and many more are sure unfortunately they do not count on how much we are liable to rise due to an recession if it were like that well then you have to choose us because we have already done that yes but we have to go back unfortunately the following is still true too big too connected to fail  yes we have done in too thats your risk and not the taxpayers if you are borrowing from banks that speculate riskily or believe the excessive promise of return buying stocks after the election the and did not push these regulations further two banks nationalized and regulations of the banking sector proposed the financial crisis in 20082009 began in the that 2009 has the then financial min thats why robust and effective regulation is needed the connection is without financial and tax policy the pure money creation by the only leads to inflation the taxpayer is going through the problems since 2008  expropriated by the banking system who pays must also have influence has restructured its banking system with the help of bailouts and its own debt how do you know this i do not play with the economic or social destiny of millions of people in wherever we have majorities we also do something see position on tax treaties with in the in the light of your tweet good that only allows 140 characters first its about my money second i know id lose even more if i provoke a massive recession thats just wrong with including and their sovereign debts came from bailouts even if its true what helps your saying because crisis management is something other than  solution if goes down the recession there will catch us they have to ask nobody doubts that but economies do not work with banking system either we see that every day our proposals go beyond that capital requirements deposit insurance prohibition of etc because unlike the in the us we have no common fiscal and taxation policy in unfortunately we have long since by the because co have interpreted the crisis as a national crisis for too long yes so have as long ago to make suggestions if however the state has to step in he must be landlords thats the way pure market economy what we in the banking sector is loss socialism profits privatized  losses socialized belong together i disagree we ask for more than years nonsense the has to do that otherwise nobody will and thats why it has to go in the 2013 general election so that it fits into its own deposit guarantee system and does not need the taxpayer we want the opposite but i can not bring all of into the in which i do not help now but thats not what wanted you can change that but you have to want the agreement is thank god not in force thats what the demand in reality they do not have them either as well as all you would have been scared if the third largest economy  would be insolvent no the purchase information about crimes is not a breach of law this is not unique to tax evasion is legal we do no it does not there is no help for without shareholders participation without conditions etc the banking sector in must finally be tamed and duly shrunk and where the state intervenes it must expropriate the banks rescue is a stopgap the real problem is the dependence of economies on the banking sector that makes us the people want above all no economic crisis as a result if we do not stabilize campaign makes the and certainly the for themselves after the election you make coalitions the is not synonymous  more what he used to be the state peers in this case yes he takes only as with any offense also references from the milieu serious and determined we live in and there is the criminal liability of the aid to organized tax evasion is not it in this case and you should ask yourself where the middle class of earns their money if goes down the drain ministries have been working against each other for more than a year result there is no progress in any field the does not exercise its control responsibility for the energy transition because many did not want it at all the alternative would then have to decide a referendum but lets wait and see what the decides would  the question remains do we want to give up the common currency or give up national sovereignty to the this or not this is now decided by the court but even if the sovereignty curtailed certainly the is not above the law but he creates new law the question is remains the sovereignty of what is actually a hyphen election campaign it is an important topic anyway and i would prefer criminal proceedings against banks like the and it is also more effective measures in or from against are thank god absolutely unthinkable in a country where the purchase of tax evasion data is nope i would  the abolition of tax secrecy in tax evasion prefer the is doing just against the ch by lifting the tax secret in tax evasion the manages to do that straight across from the ch the agreement has so many loopholes that just no money flows to the this indulgence is moral hazard because we have one who uses schools theaters universities hospitals roads etc but his money passes the tax office id ch brings acts antisocial the protest banks against the tax collectors is treacherous thats what they wanted to prevent the tax deal with i find the attacks of bankers politicians against tax inspectors from obscene tax fraud can not be prosecuted so theres no pause now its turn yes i believe that too  can i do nothing for is genetically determined so if the place was not already occupied no probably a man but you would not talk so frivolously therefore but one of us is still in the cradle no one has to give up his opinion because some chairman says something thats certainly difficult because the time spent in the is enormous i would probably try to keep certain times for it why do not you accept a conviction but degenerate everything into a tactical behavior i hope i did not miss any no i would look under fundamental rights times that is true neither of the substance nor of the proportionality but you do not seem to care less about both sorry but it will not  be leaders are neither echo nor eunuchs but chosen for your own opinion most attention has probably found in me less a special tweet but rather the way of answering provocations this honestly the fact that there are apparently incredible conspiracy theories about politics nope a meeting with the vice president of twitter those who have more humor than in the speeches in the theories and the renunciation of some originally learned civilized manners thats right but at often not well all too often you do not seem to look at it but i admit sometimes i just do not have time so do not worry thats it yet only now and then i have something  to do other things than tweet ever heard of the fundamental right to religious freedom in the goes without being a member of a group can we do that nonsense that was the last thing the did in new registration law makes the state a data dealer even against the contradiction of victims where is the indignation ad with the voices of the in the then shredded files in the protection of the describes what blame on the scandal may you call it criminal if the law enforcement agencies shred files to hide contacts with the where are the investigators for the flowers and for the more in my interview today  and who lets word bubbles rise well so better do nothing the financial markets are left to themselves that was fatal strategy over years of parties coke they confuse the characters dear again to the newspaper archive interesting to read about how two are so united that any form of representative democracy is a bourgeois dictatorship and that in addition to taxpayers the financial markets are finally contributing to the banking crisis i understand well nevertheless have moved the burden of the fiscal pact from municipalities to the federal government to make it so important to clarify that all and benefit from unity  if you can not see the connection between mass redundancies in the collective bargaining conflict fight for a social i can not help it we must not let degenerate into an elite project my speech on in the and in the midst of collective bargaining 1000 clinic employees will be terminated here is our letter to those affected this is especially especially for go oh yes we talk about full time jobs whose business model is based on the state subsidizing the wages of its employees has no business model ironically the to ask this question is already cute what are we doing right now ever read the newspaper no question is subsidizing people who are not in gainful employment  want through people who have to do that not a fair model right but in a year is chosen unfortunately thats true but you can also do something against on the contrary good work good pay is the right motto why not it is not the task of the state to subsidize wages permanently matter for what activity exactly and it is also unfair for entrepreneurs who pay fairly competitors subsidized the states wage the motto applies only to people the one does not exclude the other but the cause remains the growing imbalance in the he is no longer justifiable i also think that the decisions on temporary work were wrong but we wanted minimum wage they have prevented  the speculations have first led to gigantic public debt because only so jobs could be saved at the moment it is the other way around the weak countries pay our wealth because they import our goods and we live on it why not they need it what they do is the opposite they usually socialize their losses why we urgently need a legal minimum wage working and still poor i can only wish for so much mischief get well soon i follow only one woman my no that means for example the end with the mutual tax reduction competition we try it are claims that many others also raise only were so far against it  its also a reason birth defects lack of common financial economic policy with the aim approximation of the economy amp social efficiency despite the negotiation success for a fix the of federal government accepts comprehensive package growth financial and why is it fair to see workers in paid work finance others for no reason you were mistaken in the address can happen i have always been against would have higher taxes just because a part wants to escape the labor market tempo 30 in inner cities federal politicians should rather leave such questions to local politicians they can  to judge that better no not the common currency has gone but the abandonment of common financial tax economic policy must end it was the federal party convention of the which wanted to hold the party convention per year without media 363 days are public have been confronted with such slogans for 150 years not infrequently they were the enemies of democracy was accepted by even by the conservative and liberal governments of i have the grace of late birth there was no one who would have demanded that and here they are volunteers of the base nonsense but here are no political professionals gathered and its not for everyone to always talk in front of the camera if tomorrow the citizens  they want to be heard on our continent all over the world they have to speak with voice a party is as as it is relaxed yes you will need it said it a few times at least times a year our people want to discuss without media the irresponsible financial market jugglers irresponsible governments see gr unfortunately brought about together because our people want to meet and discuss at least twice a year without a media public that was the desire of the members to be able to meet without media representatives i can understand that at the 1st party convention today i demanded the of the union a generational task as an elite project is at an end the needs  a fresh start in addition my interview on without legal basis in the that is absolutely impossible why they do not exist ask yes that is a conceivable instrument of money distribution without conditions better spending in the budget 20 billion of unused resources capital increase financial market tax  unfortunately the are completely against it did but did differently is better than anyone else through the crisis in 2008 experience makes smart not ideology exactly why tax financial markets and use revenue i think so and me am member without too domestic policy on the backs of millions of no thanks you will not earn more coal in if waters no one can buy more export id agree you need a majority in the they do not get you with put nothing concrete growth in and nothing against stranglehold financial markets as long as no agreement  with the are doing just as if we were already in the matter of the fiscal and growth pact thats true only for the financial market tax we are for the recording referendums to the but that fails for years to tax the polluter of the speculations and not plunder the passbooks therefore financial transaction tax different than in other states but with regulation we have long introduced legislative proposals then we should go to establishments that live from exporting to neighbors theres a lot of that there very many good book about responsibility political commitment a life protestantism politics we are  referendums in the law i would never come to that but everyone puts on the shoe that suits him do you notice no thats the way it is we are currently more and more involved because policies are bringing to a standstill no because pension funds are excluded its about derivatives etc decision this propaganda does not get better by repeating it policy is leading to more debt so life no you have to raise it constitutionally that was not the case then unequal treatment of money and real estate assets the joke on is that anyone can use it the way they want and that they still understand even with you no the  proposal of the of to the debt redemption fund requires repayment by the debtor just do wealth tax on the contrary the financial market taxation finally the taxpayer we want the debt redemption fund and the too and both are good absolutely it is about deciding what needs to grow renewable energies and what should shrink consumption of raw materials unfortunately not quite the contrary wants to raise top tax rates as long as you understand it it does not seem to be that hard to read do not worry well just prove it i can find that quite a scandal  no why should we socialists are working together for the financial transaction tax and the regulation of the financial markets very good visit to president need growth pact drive forward instead of sinking go through the federal government must take the first steps towards taxing the financial markets next week finally accept the need for a growth pact the alone leads into the economic banking regulation is mandatory but it is not being pushed by the current government no i have not but catch up is a smart guy error the is a pure market economy the co cause of the crisis must also pay for the consequences  which do you mean i do not know any unbearable expressions from him really not interested in saving banks letting them go bankrupt but unfortunately its even more costly because they did it alone from me you can also become minister of agriculture you just should not behave like an ox exactly that happens when under a too high result more debt it is also internally not easy acts as if one has nothing to do with the other and does not provide any concrete proposals for growth initiatives without growth initiatives fiscal pact leads to the squandering of tax billions because the bailouts only help banks do not understand  that fiscal pact growth markets are internally related only save increases the debt well you ask the if the economy collapses completely in a major bank failure but synonymous experience that you can do on twitter too not mine its up to you thats it must and above all not be so this is what we do but we come to other experiences on your responsibility yes for 150 years and the results are far better than those of the professional revolutionaries just so to show that we are not guilty of to all but i admit there is still enough about what campaign theme  is crucial never parties but always people with what moves the topic moves many yes i am interested it was very conscious in the district and always a man is not just a womans task what you never ask is how much does the alternative cost and who counts on it my mother always said it says faster you a hole than you a hole therefore you should be careful your memory is wrong wanted full equality with marriage that has failed in the at the union we too and remember that do not come together it does not fail either but at we also and remember that green there are already examples as far as i know  at least not with war rhetoric and helpless is the because are inactive do not even tolerate sanctions this is not the worst name confusion we do that every day yes well then go but say that to the other who desperately want and need the i do not care about carpet flights they seem to have escaped that the wanted equality with marriage the has stopped it in the its not about daring but about whats right and good for and putting only on austerity is wrong so that finance and adoption agencies and courts finally see it that way then just leave it yes that will be  when the financial market the growth package is not coming the second too because we need the money more urgently in the you have to ask the nature lovers i do not have it against a vote by the on 286 is nothing to complain about whether the is also voted is open good event with the and equality of life partnerships with marriage is overdue yes you also need them especially if you want to combine work and family against yourself keep it as you want i do it too and i do not care what did you ask not in why should we punish with a boycott  the nuclear plant

with tells as sweeping as this man who has experienced it myself have discussed with also on nuclear energy and warned will be  with the consequential costs of nuclear energy the political dispute

to us by i am not a fan of conspiracy theories on the poems yes what a nonsense to put copyright into context one must be ignorant or malicious thats the way it is is off or agreed yes it is often forgotten that behind some positions criminal transactions  hide you probably confused something would be a way to find out if its true the question of whether the things you are negotiating are related to each other well wish you something is but not was just in negotiations but who inform me now no speculation on financial markets in 2008 the world id led trillions of debt were the result right that alone will not be enough my grandma said what i think and do i trust each other with you too my friends name is more information nice if you go through life so completely unprejudiced right a  of course tomorrow ill go to football and with an old friend pay my card problem is it something already nope but 140 characters is just short the basis is the proposal of the and he is anything but symbolic if time is better late than never were the biggest besides at level with the financial market tax finally pay the cause of the financial crisis and growth will be financed without new loans copyright protection is illegal million shops and crime in the theft of intellectual property not the in addition artists want to create effective copyright protection together creative from is most important potential first big progress  follow after 12 years of our demand for financial market tax now the growth package is missing for marriage gays invite to debate about gender equality 116 here thats one of the topics well discuss today as a north i have nothing against storms but on the contrary you will have to live with it today musicians and other artists come to us the wants to protect the rights of artists researchers and authors prof beck paid exchange of citizens of all ages in civil society initiatives helps to build from below just agreed with to bring his idea of volunteer initiative in the current debate thats the way it is and its accepted  law as directly applicable law its about a constitutional with constitution what he will not personally accept under law is likely to quickly surprise at which acts others do not feel like doing no its about legally compliant behavior contracts including ones are binding and who picks something for family support there is a better instrument through a higher child allowance for earners relief money brings a few parents in a difficult choice between money and education for their children the gradual abolition of contributions relief is a second issue that you do not want to work with the wrong instruments or  help to reduce the shortage of skilled workers and to relieve families financially by spend where the need is greatest the lack of places and schools this helps the children and the parents do not be angry with me but i do not understand what you want we want to do something very simple we want the money there the fines that were passed against have also resulted in legal changes in colleague as you will soon have to collect such promises again why are you ready to open up to the content industry via etc there are billions more data stored the last elections point to something else completely reassured on our own ideas  the you really do not seem to know when is allowed to occur their comparisons are adventurous but i do not think going to duck away political conflict is part of democracy incidentally conspiracy theories are not access to telephone and connections takes place without content and only after judgment decision black crime thats your right and my duty is not to leave you in the dark i admire people who make no mistakes secured for up to months crimes can be a court arranging the connection no one bugs all households and connections will be on the companies these too will cause to behave in accordance with the contract  i would not have a problem with that but in this case as far as i know this is a convention oh yes on corporeal integrity and a state that protects against the most serious crime then you should avoid the social networks because thats where the will meet you more often its good if you do not fool each other neither before nor after a choice i have to disappoint you and i wonder how one can make a choice dependent on a single political question in pursuit of the most serious offenses in data access that should be total surveillance nonsense sorry months to save phone data with the phone company no content storage and therefore tare this contradiction out  this is exactly what the demands of us and the too yes the is in conflict with the just as the demands on freedom and safety always stand it works how can one fritter so to compare the temporary storage of telephone data with wrong but your right and you can hide your education well that is no reason to break law now the constitutional court names exact limits of the we will comply do not worry we will not do that a second time probably only after 2013 when rule the want the energy transition namely for turning your own minority position into a majority but exit open no question and yet 40 percent say no majority  for this position also means acting of the majority above all we need new market design present one can be renewable do not integrate fossil fuels gas answer you should be proud to be part of a party where there is more than your opinion because the rest of the buys our goods services much more than we shop elsewhere we live from export id we are net payers as far as tax money goes give in more than we get out but at the same time private net winners nope but not everything that is called facts is what they are often its just a lot of conspiracy theory ideology in virtually every release of the this is our main theme nonsense i just have a different opinion than  your this has nothing to do with slap in the face do not always dramatize everything what does your question relate to rule of law thats what law is about does not mean that you only stay tuned if it fits you so the bill will not work the violation of law is not just a financial problem yes but it probably lacks an idea about where in the challenges lie the has brought us first with their blockade to the because is not an option realpolitik at least makes politics union are more of a nongovernmental organization is not in our decision the in should prevent new elections everyone gets a sweetie certainly not  i also you today thank you will try it and i think synonymous create government policy has reached the level of a bazaar all important topics education energy minimum wage etc remain the union the superfluous care allowance and the may again lobbying policy make private insurance trade instead of coalition summit no common policy but everyone can choose something even if the other is against it do not worry hatred is certainly not rather it is a tragedy to see what has become of him but there i have the grace of late birth we are against it and reject it i think that after his ego trip against the now the again small is a successful i can say now that often  nothing to laugh you have naive ideas about the management failure at jobs temporary to make poorly paid sensible works council will hinder your flexibility only because of fixed fair she has majority in only helps choose 2013 differently abolish care allowance again and the money id kindergartens are only political continuation with state guarantees was the concept not continuous operation as a catchup society again stones were put in the way by those who never wanted to return in without the we would never have gotten this far and we would still be  continue if the not always for me land guarantees are more like thousands of jobs for the women than for tank shipments to thousands of women who become unemployed for which the attempt of a solution would have been worthwhile it is not about the abolition of temporary work but about fair pay equal work equal pay the problem after the training is not the minimum wage but remote dual system is better broke there are responsible catastrophic management blockade in the rescue attempt why not if he seriously cares such problems as in the aces can only be solved together the question is always how much work  should create flexibility do not abolish good jobs has but you are right all parties have not taken care of themselves for decades just to remind you it was about the continuation of deregulation in the labor market by the speaks of minimum wages in education there are already only training allowances anyway is that id export industries the sector is not at home nor was it right to allow this sector since i do not know your name i can not follow up visit of the new in the ailing nuclear waste disposal camp he knows after days more than his predecessor after years bit of foaming at the mouth for a serious argument  you should become a politician this includes the habit of spreading false quotes alas to the good sound no one does that but you probably want to be essentially right thats it the comparison of social and economic data shows it or a visit to neighboring countries only someone who does not know the plight of many on the job market can talk that way thats what been doing for a long time for all the mistakes of the as well our policy seems to have better prepared the country than other countries no at that time as well as the week without full pay compensation the only chance to create jobs course therefore we have long since decided and will bring a proposal before the election in the has with populism  nothing to do but with yes i understand many people have feeling there to have to beg something even though they work and the feeling i can understand also better spending in the yes it has to be countercyclical again but not pumped up but funded taxation of the financial markets that would save the a lot of time actually this is the normal work of a deputy offers only an additional opportunity well dear man not every wish comes true yes no idea what talking about not a fan of conspiracy theories quote  is not enough reading and understanding is important as i said we know what was wrong then and what we need to change in the labor market minimum wages it is not about a company but about the system riches would not be enough for us it seems that she is high but she is so late that she does not bring any money we did not lock up anybody it was also see renewable energy school program living conditions etc more if necessary it is a case for the prosecutor every three months she does what she dismissed as unthinkable three months earlier there is no point in voting against her there is a law in politics  if does in politics after every months what we suggested earlier an imposition is the working conditions that he describes yes thats right but my impression is at there are more legitimate allegations than only lousy wages however thats why we have long ago made proposals for in the labor market and for a statutory minimum wage of course it is still about a statutory minimum wage for all but here there are far more accusations than only dumping wages minimum wages and a of lending and temporary work are the necessary central corrections to the reforms at that time we already know ourselves what we have done wrong the difference is only and want to continue this way no we want him for a growth and growth  supplement the investment pact how the rest also true reveals inhumane working conditions they are forbidden commission of inquiry in the thats really nonsense the fiscal pact alone increases debt as economies collapse under budget cuts thats why its about drastically reducing this insane period of time i hope so one thing you have to leave you you will not let up look how came out of the financial crisis by government investment in growth energy savings deregulation and degenerate the state see education infrastructure etc has brought nothing anyway in that  he hopefully does better than his predecessor this is not difficult i do not know that in the end the will decide not alone but the social democracy together the fiscal pact must be supplemented by a growth and investment pact financed by financial markets in addition i say relief pact is important if one wants to reduce the dependence on financial markets but 60000 students every year a total of 15 million are already under 30 without qualified vocational training with all mistakes which made also the without us it is nothing with a change of direction in the policy the industry is long been id sales markets all the more important are good location conditions in thats certainly a problem  which can only be counteracted by preserving your own innovation no i hope we regulate and tax financial markets in order to reinvest in growth new insights not but experiencing the concern on the ground is already a different motivation than what to read in files have i answered a few times we are against it because it destroys the value of work is also priceless change is only possible if you choose to go for example educational investment helps to reduce skills shortages so that no more 60000 students stay without graduation yes it is about down comparatively small considering that the share exports id is still 60 he has been there several times when he was not even in office and it has used a great deal finally the nuclear law applies  he has to make decisions about the possible process accelerations i have also been doing this as a constituency member for more than 20 years the aces is not a remnant of a government but the misconception of the controllability of atomic energy is the economic winner of the and now we have to give something back neither the one nor the other training not sufficiently trained we will now in addition to our own efforts also recruiting abroad the industry is not entirely innocent of it for years was warned of an oversupply and in the field of commercial the old minister of took two years to drive to the ailing nuclear the new one comes after weeks very good the negotiations at level until at least  to 256 last for maybe even until nothing is decided before the convention but even the will not be able to evaluate anything conclusively because but that is why we are fighting with many other for a growth and investment pact no he is not by nature this requires rule business assets are not affected second these taxes start above millions of dollars in allowance where exactly should i get into in my role as a member of the constituency since regular company visits are part of everyday business do you need a lightning conductor if so everything is of my salary is dirt allowance of the entrepreneur the family topic skilled workers recruits professionals who  has crafted the craft well expensive est omen but i can not promise another one around me but around the other id family they have to simply quote my gr daughter i understand the media already but that does not have to mean that i join in or accept everything apart from that it is not i would rather do it if it suits is probably not necessary because it would certainly take someone lose weight for this he has not come to us and as a longtime friend he knows that too i try to keep my private life out of politics anyway the wife and daughters are not in politics thank you there are honestly nothing nicer  but we finally need it for the appropriate increase in education spending yes even those like the use it for revenue such as the property tax etc i still think so just a few examples programs for energy saving and building renovation network expansion broadband they do not have to be either one or the other i just answered and why such messages are in the media or is beyond me private matter do i have to do this here i think weeks ago i made proposals for funding for the refurbishment to the new ob so far no reaction somehow is strangely not in the near future not on the program  surely we will not commit the stupidity is not so now its over for today now its turn and while there is nothing good except you do it or at least try unfortunately i can understand you there are unfortunately enough reasons for your fear and yet applies the fact is unfortunately there is growth pact otherwise it would not have to be negotiated now the is supposedly even taxing the financial markets and many in the too so only courage even the money for bank rescue served the people 20082009 otherwise there would have been mass unemployment please ask made him last year proposals for a quick achievement of the  in order only be at simplification many rules have reasons id of living for information only there were about 25 summit of the heads of government id was the first to focus on growth no i do not think so it invalidates work and is priceless in any case no longer plays any role because they can no longer refinance themselves on the credit market i agree thats true but if something sensible comes out you have to help her yes yes pure loan financing would be just a straw fire therefore there must be sustainable financing in the budget if you live in my area i would take you to the businesses and jobs here they depend on it hopefully not  thank you we try it anyway i have already done that in the but nobody from the federal government dared even go to the lectern the negotiations with the federal government will certainly not before the 166 be over has to do that now does not agree with your assumption rolling course actually my advice please read the report of the on the there you will find your answer fewer employees in unified than before in a top tax rate from 49 of 100000  onwards does not hit the middle class and saved in for a long time the other nations shopping with us cars mechanical engineering etc we have earned in those not just those at us one of the basic misconceptions is that we only ever pay we are the economic winners of the because the the one third of adolescents background without vocational training reason late promotion and on 166 at our party convention we will discuss the state of negotiations with on the proposals on their sustainability and fair financing the approval of the to the fiscal pact will depend wants to 136 present what proposals it will make for a growth pact in from the quality of this it is good that made a change of course  has finally prepared to link the to a growth pact to the truth belongs that parties in the federation have done wrong in the last decades he will do that where did you send it the did not do it and i think thats right your questions about the debt redemption fund are correct and it is quite possible that the conditions for this must be more restrictive than proposed by the of in substance however the suggestion is correct we achieved partial success in the pays the costs in the future security in old age 42 billion  therefore the federal government must assume the financial responsibility for legal tasks which it assigns to the municipalities a first is right but why not the top tax rate use the wealth tax for education instead of debt because they only take us seriously and i enjoy it very big mistake pretty awake and happy its always a nice start to the weekend its always a nice start to the weekend must be occasionally otherwise it gets boring not the answers of the voters but yours anyway it is limited has clear conditions and is not good the social cultural division in the country is increasing if it is not  sustainable growth package in this is not possible with this government i do not know the specific problem in your case therefore can not answer your question you have to do one without leaving the other one as of 2013 there is also a legal claim to nursery places entitlement to a 36 has been around since the the president of the must implement the decisions of the and there are even the for because that certainly does not exist in the well who comes too late well well you know the rest cultural promotion and education play against each other i think is fundamentally wrong thats why  did we when we ruled in have introduced the master on the contrary we create the conditions for this growth so i would never say that attitude of the and the we need taxation of the financial markets and debt redemption funds still in dispute between and refuses to comment on the financial transaction tax coalition blocked because says no stage success gives up blockade against growth pact and moves towards growth and investment program for parents have the right to finance a day care or even a loss of earnings that is why we have enforced the right to do so from 2013 onwards where that is not fulfilled that  he certainly does absolutely right that is one of the reasons why we need a common defense and security policy in the problem of the is not the people but their inner programmatic disruption nobody can govern with that that is why we are in favor of higher wealth and capital taxation parliaments may id sovereignty is not restricted by the assumption of large commitments by because the declares that the limits of the constitution are reached with the rescue parachutes coming then you obviously do not look into often enough we every  you can spend only once the biggest shortage is in kindergartens and schools so there must be priority there its better than unemployment and our parents grandparents have not done anything else no problem but abolishing the fees establishing family education should bring educationally disadvantaged classes closer to early support yes thats why the abolished tuition fees where it leads state governments why is doing better because it is normal there for school educators social sports and theater educators yes the danger will continue in the future but the number does not have to be so huge see northern abroad day care centers into family education centers especially in social schools  nonsense we can afford this the shortage of skilled workers does not seem to be big enough in our country 60000 students without graduation hundreds of thousands of young qualified women unable to work because of childcare so long the saying is just stupid sorry we do not pay to brake affects current limit longterm financial obligations for has just drawn the i do not see us but the turbulence on financial markets benefits of the statutory pension insurance made clear only on the way of negotiations true do not believe everything that is in the newspaper yes then our jobs will go the question is who uses the crash of economies  at least not both is important on the contrary it is about interests if we help to grow because we live from the export of our products for example by lifting banking secrecy in towards the and not just against the us we only live well in if the rest of is doing means they have to buy our goods can on the tax debt and not on the income tax rate the average tax rate is about 30 49 are the marginal tax rate thus applies only to the amounts above 100000  to the 55 relates you have now alliance against youth unemployment with new prime minister in proposals for growth pact as supplement to the find agreement of the parties of settlement without economic growth does not exist i think the idea of debt repayment fund is correct they are also common bonds but with conditions why should that be an alternative we need both sits next to me and laughed heartily at your tweet from the party that is probably a big praise of course without the collapse the dispute is about the terms of the fiscal pact and not about the  i share opinion you do not seem to have read the tweet correctly not me bonds plead but and i find the taxation of the financial markets the better instrument again with a large majority including the votes of the for the financial transaction tax president of the just told me the has approved by a large majority including the president of the just told me the won with the votes of the conservatives i know see black buildings in the proposal of redemption fund is better than an debate on warns against too rigid a stance on yes you have to in fact  also do is a bad example of what happens if you allow corruption well do our very best strange subsidy term if you mean investing in infrastructure research saving energy good decisions can even be made in one afternoon through existing funds instead of farm subsidies capital increase by market tax sure the conservatives are also moving everyone sees that without growth impulses the debts rise instead of sinking yes i can only answer selectively because i can not answer all the tweets but what question are you asking financing of increased investment in education by raising the top tax rate to 49 and taxing large fortunes education investment  by 20 billion limitation of temporary work and today meeting of socialists in fight against youth unemployment and proposals for a growth pact in success for growth package joint protection of private investments in concrete projects not always why yesterday they made it clear that it was just  no generalization is allowed guys do you have to let go of your frustration over your club again at the well we have a streak the one who does it as example yesterday showed certainly no expert on this question but i found the reasoning of the police officer conclusive this only works through the clubs yesterday there was an interesting talk show vs violence in football hard but fair yet an absolutely convincing who wants to know what i have debated today with women of the listen here a state that wants good health and care for the elderly must not promote wage dumping he needs the the good performance fair paid today good conversation with president it shows again  the is our competence center for social issues dedicated conflict must be and is a sign of seriousness and not of insulting the was the most engaged and exhausting debate i i clear open contentious and therefore good also in government formations but also hot discussions about the party reform more money for womens politics must make womens politics a social policy again and not a special topic and absolute parity this morning women they have me as party chairman neat heated the application for equal pay for women men lie in the and are rejected there by the majority its people to the state sends which raises the wages at least on iv  not fair competition companies that pay fair wages but can not compete when competitors pay poverty wages and then no not because of the lack of skilled workers and 11 billion wage subsidy for poverty wages leads to losses today jobs yes just look into the statute of the there they are forms of participation in it you have to do it  even its strategy not tactics and there is nothing wrong with that nice to see how members followers break our heads sure just to help us heres how we do it you can do it only with majorities temporary workers are not covered by the tariff of the company in which they work and many companies are why yes to create jobs instead of overtime but not to make fixed jobs temporary jobs can you join us one can probably only come to the assessment if ones own prejudices allow nothing else elections because the of the government bad is but sure union do not dare  my advice read the whole message and not just the headline yes already booked in by because the model does not guarantee ii independence even when working exactly what its about it is worth reading the whole message of the and not just the headline to create conditions that make a successful life possible for everyone by members if there are several candidates but at some point top candidates will be selected as in the yes i agree thats why i suggested it unfortunately the majority of our members were only for a primary vote its my pleasure the one or the other we would have quickly if union the way to new elections free  would therefore it needs a change of direction if that were so there would be no democracies must enforce the policy as well as minimum wages and that will only succeed with the to the full wage the permanent employees get or as in where temporary workers can get even 10 more yes a real minimum wage where nobody has to beg for work at the state no if there were new elections there are not because of coalition fear in front of the voters we would do it very quickly the problem is only does not listen to you by collective agreement metal industry to limit lending temporary work is on it enforce equal pay for equal work good wage agreement by the takeover of trainees  in fixed jobs and limitation of lending and temporary work as i said get well soon well then get well soon but the day is already occupied with a family celebration not everyone who calls himself left is also reasonable and the sister party of the is the thats a wise decision in addition to everything else its nice here is it with you yes it does lets put it this way there was the even in the cradle but the foundation in is considered the birthplace also curious anyone who writes open letters and does not even send them off at least i did not get one does not want an answer why should not there be a majority and other countries show it the social word of the  is impressive still up to date discussion on social justice that had like a good dozen times now real nope just no jealousy the federal figures will come tomorrow poll for for tomorrow 32 36 green 13 pirates we have sorry noticed earlier lets see but seems more likely to own their own politics not diplomacy because no one crawls up in there so why always maintain the old friendships the new ones are quickly gone again it is not bad to know how you feel when you have lost you have then very loose legs there are so many again that 140 characters are not enough  become apostate of our weight class human what do they do with our good and vice versa at home he wanted that but even that step did not allow him any more does not even let resign but throws him out shortly before mercilessly but no hasty conclusions i have your questions now really answered technically this is not a problem yes but perhaps it makes sense to abolish them altogether you have to evaluate the experience the is now getting to know the development in proves the opposite investments during the crisis 200809 debt reduction now forgotten no that does not mean it decision  more that alone delegates officials but i think at some point by citizens now the decision that a primary vote must take place among all members if there are several candidates so no i wanted to enforce that in the statute reform of the last year but that went too far for my party but at least there is the maiden is definitely me 12 1959 we will soon be making the appointment my impression is there is much disinformation why probably little i did not ask but due to the time i take it no not exactly by the way is the best proof we invested in the crisis if he gets his way yes lets see the ones the states are talking about  had to make such high debts the speculators ad financial markets financial market tax a good reds only for red so it is that was reasonable as unreasonable as who said in the election campaign to work only with he is not called last night he stays at his course of consolidation he wants to talk to us about it in they express themselves otherwise you would have answered why the state was in debt because gamblers ruined the real economy gamblers do not pay have undermined the market economy profits socialized union that was wise our economic data shows today and we can reduce debt again the unjust is only gamblers would have been terrible thats why all states have  also is in debt to protect the innocent in the economy had gambled the consequences for wholly uninvolved companies small and enterprises and employees up to normal savings you seem to have not remembered in 200809 we have to make gigantic debts because they are banks and financial markets what do you mean that too is not true in apparently not thats the problem rightly always points to this yes there is and you have to do everything to change that but absolute control does not exist and would probably be more expensive more for investment less debt and lower taxes thats the actual national dumbing down if you are in motion then you should be upset that politicians always the following at the same time  promise more for education more i recommend the following look at infrastructure education health care etc in and compare it thats just a fact see in the financial crisis i have nothing against popular votes congratulations this could be the absurdity of the month all attention i have already heard a lot of criticism but that we want the in is really something new no i just do not see the problem that you believe you can see in it no not all as you can see are you feeling better after a few insults then just courage parts of my salary are dirt allowance  we talk about 40 to 50 percent of youth unemployment in god its not in thats something to us in addition to some mistakes the last 60 years of success in prove the opposite of your claim here are our demands for a growth pact in ways out of the crisis this applies to not for the majority of our press to is already be broadcast live on other the right time quite a without economic help is not enough your reference has for the quality of the his reasoning for me no argument why i should be against it socially and culturally and you are  as well as victims of the financial markets of the are of course partners creating and securing jobs training often interacting companies craftsmanship but also many companies too much honor thats what we were not for once in the center combat youth unemployment fiscal pact alone is leading to more and more debt as the economy collapses this morning 10 together with in the press conference topic ways out of the crisis in we are really trying the most normal thing in the world that politicians give answers in my constituency it is thank you but i am surprised by your surprise  i can not respond to every tweet but its thats right for the rest i will certainly suggest the one or the one who has the best chance if i were you i would take a look at where jobs come from from the even if thats true what good is your exclusive view of the past we are on our own time will tell the choice is in 12 years positions on lending and temporary work labor market and pension all states including the not everything that sounds alien to ears must be a conspiracy in international politics and the total dependence on unregulated financial markets  the apart from no proof of the failure but for the failure means budgetary reservation of the of governors can only decide unanimously and must observe the national reservations in what you mean by immunity you have to explain to me again the capital stock can not be changed at any time arbitrary now seriously no speech no article no interview on in which we do not say that loud and unmistakable but i do just not always and everywhere communication always comes first you asked me for the and i answered not everything was right no question thats why we have 2005 2009 too  lost and corrected us long ago we are more than years i do not believe that even there their voters notice that create the policy change has my wife complained also there are far stronger than need the otherwise they face a catastrophic situation you can not ad without help refinance capital markets i had already responded to the on tweets one should not confuse the with the fiscal pact especially the i agree well probably did not work you have to take the life the as it she is but you must not let it her like that there is a wise phrase from an old democrat too  fits in already happened yesterday was a good drop do not hope yes but 140 characters nevertheless you are right yes it will not be easy in 2013 but one thing is true have since 11 state elections no longer own majority election shows when it comes to something greens a majority overcoming growing cultural split in the most important thing first big thank you to all who helped in to the dedicated campaigners supporters inside your success shows course keeping is rewarded after all you are more polite than for the last round who wants force she must choose until 18 who stays at home or something else  marks chooses it makes no sense to play off supply orientation against demand orientation we will need a mix of instruments for arguing that speculation with food are banned there is also a transfer union rest of to or what do you think export surpluses arise calls other people blowflies as you do is in bad and very society the term blowflies with respect to people has a bad tradition in as an elite project right criticism as a dictatorship nonsense and trivialization of the term dictatorship and third you would have id referendum not only in and that would certainly not be negative  second because without the countries around us would be in catastrophic trouble and reach us first because we have earned trillion in monetary union we export the rest of buys products nonsense what are you betting with me you do not even notice that you have adopted the language of the anyone under real  has suffered must turn in your mail the stomach world economists are divided thats me progress recently they have all extolled us still the freedom of financial markets yes that can be in the long run it is better to go to get into trouble for fear of always only to text that was a cool number and a political blind date via for the wine nice holiday her name is program i said as a politician you have to form an opinion not to every question already have happen on the contrary party politician en have an opinion or try to form one yes no question but if it does not work otherwise from 10 clock together with  in to the election on clear conditions for create vote well there has probably more of the secret wish led the feather do not be angry but thats just nonsense too bad it was a joke i could have used either of these nobody says that the release of sales was correct then but mistakes make sure only politicians that i believe that allegedly believe not even the initially promoted all successful key technologies the direction must be right if not careful with your voices who does not want to choose thats why we want to reform the incapacity or reduction pension plan open access nothing against  my buddy all support in the final spurt for election in mood in the final spurt for in i saved the although he was never in danger because both want to extend it only to the your logic does not open to me but one thing is clear when you reduce taxes you also have to say where you save me too sure and riding lessons free horse and cigars what did you think does not work without growth in the end there will be a growth pact in addition to the fiscal pact and will say knows that this is no longer possible nobody wants to cancel the fiscal pact but he who would have thought that  i enjoy it but these small incomes will have to pay more for fees tax losses in municipalities higher fees who pays no taxes because he she earned too little or has children has nothing of your tax cut well tell your friends in the how to call into the net just must look at the information stand my interlocutors in the face to listen to us since all the of the have to wait now until i answer their questions nice now its in the election campaign ask him the little people have nothing of the planned cut because they pay no taxes but for the electricity prices are dampened by the renewable energies  because they push expensive marginal cost power plants from the market well then ask excessive electricity prices were in front of the renewable energies just inquire at right i think liberals are in favor of compliance thats it for example like comply or duties no idea if we do that but we actually stick to the ask your government that can certainly give information the solar companies would be profitable if there was a level playing field but is not there was a mistake but as high as under 53 he could not stay therefore 49 said that of course there are reasons did not say so but if you want to know if the mistakes  has done clear but the wants to continue its just not everything in my life no i do not know what else happens to you in life but here is not a fake nope then there is a lot to school reform relaxation policy help for liberation movements etc etc hotelier tax protection for tax evaders the break of all election promises to tax reduction by the country produces cheaper has the most efficient production makes dumping prices and violates why is there a successful aerospace industry it has been massively subsidized in the beginning the massive dumping in is the problem when production declines there the innovation eventually lands there  think no its about own power production on the roof of a tenement that wanted to stop life in contrast to mining the subsidies in the are and disappear the is a market launch program but then also the successes of the last 150 years and by the way was able to reject reasonable work even then before iv already the social assistance to  oh yes it existed long before just like iv 19 help for work and employment paid with you do not have to follow that yes initiative came from the has participated in countries and has not forced us to abstain success wins the in the for a stop sign in the solar cut chance  to receive thousands of jobs contribution of to copyright in the do not worry its not that bad no its about transformation of the electricity sector with a new just not how wants it nonsense die currently has enough to do with controlling the radio waves of no it ensures that externalized costs climate damage are finally internalized market economy first there is enough time during car and train travel and second why should it be a young lady no not until well just only high school student the first education policy has given the chance to graduate from high school there was nothing  with its not about an oversupply but about the market design on the electricity market and the profit is more than 350000 new jobs in the renewable energy industry thats right of course but the amazing thing is that the countries are also fighting hard apparently its about the matter at least were working on it yes but thats not what the is about its about the development of a key technology of the 21st century just for information through the effect renewable energies reduce the price of electricity just have a look at the yes that is another reason why the amendment has to be dealt with the proposal kills all roof systems on houses either or with interpreter satisfied  big chance in the wants to win for stopping the massive solar cuts otherwise danger for thousands of jobs and for nuclear phase out so end with tweeting now comes an night session but still energies to rescue before in the because someone claims it does not have to be right but discuss it as soon as public even those do not lead to a 50 percent tax on all income to those who can not work or find work yes therefore the cost of living for all who can not escape paid work not with the this is unfortunately not only in so in no case abolition the copyright contract law must the rights of authors artists etc stronger  protect as today anyone who thinks that everyone can explain to themselves what he considers unconstitutional will wonder who reports everything there is the wish of the father of thought yes you even have to only with allegations such as unconstitutionality is there just one instance that ultimately decides about it i agree the judgment has just declared the part that you declare unconstitutional to be unconstitutional which is a language force makes i know of no influence of the on any study freedom and security are definitely in conflict its always about the balance correct the realm of freedom however begins where the realm of necessity ends  again what is unconstitutional decides in only one instance the court there is an unconditional basic income social assistance those who want to raise them must say who pays them well mister colleague to bring facts to 140 characters does not have to misrepresent them the countries have developed it and want to bring it into the but you do not know much about tax progression right its not about 50 of the salary away to control yes in 150 years of history already wanted many but you would hardly like the company of these people the right to social assistance can not completely go under our constitution if it had been an excess of the goal  no problem my suspicion the author is serious of my salary is dirt allowance to be honest its fun at first but the tweets also show the catastrophic image of politics in society is it treason if the criticizes policy answers the world accusation here the world link in addition reactions with if they were unconstitutional why they were not lifted by the its a deal  bumpy better on every ship that sinks steaming there is one who waves in the end is in the yes only what has become because the always or are good counterexamples of your claim if the still understands but unfortunately they do not know the title and content of his book  more human what are you picking up on everything this can also be understood as a threat so about 45 minutes ago yes sure both the and can tell you that for sure neither do i find the pirates cuddly nor do i believe that you represent the with deniers is smarter if there is something for which the stands for 150 years then for freedom but solidarity is a pledge of freedom world editor called he too finds the term traitor betrayer inappropriate thats extraordinary thanks for that moving visit at the forum in the burial ground are thousands of murdered prisoners buried many members calls me chevron king from the chirping understands the certainly more  as of probably it is still too low because the first message from was years ago not a cent for today in the time interview which separates us from the and connects with many pirates ill do my very best that is still our view because it always makes everything too late the financial markets neither regulated nor taxed but everything has become 100 times more expensive how do you get on the narrow board if someone throws more and more money then their chancellor because she was always amazed why definitely no coalition at the federal level the are two parties in one and if you have more questions feel free to contact do not be me  bad that is not it but about untaxed black money dear boys and girls of the firstly you did not even then convinced your own parliamentarians secondly consider whether your call for brainwashing did not hide your intellect a bit too much and thirdly it was your chancellor and your party colleague who bravely ignored the warnings of the socialist opposition leader against counterfeit statistics in order not to annoy your party friends in gr its not about investing but about tax evasion this is a crime up to 10 years imprisonment threat to refresh their memory gaps next to us all other member states and also the reintroduction  the wealth tax top tax rate from 100000 annual income single to 49 sorry what should i answer are the ones whose names you can find on the thank you for your work this morning special conference with former political prisoners of the in more than 20 years later stop transfiguration  more than 5000 were persecuted by also reminiscent of the conference of today in so now is the end for today now is being communicated again until tomorrow their data is used far more than the democratic state could ever do how much must one actually neglect fascism to call the debate in for no but it helps to clarify structures and prosecution see but not what you do with your data where to sell them etc i am not in favor of tightening the in favor of the state but for stricter rules organized crime and terror too if everything else is unimportant to you  is then thats probably true play the multinational data groups in 1984 yes but i do not understand the weights in the debate anymore the is placed under everything and in the time for you rarely read such a nonsense conspiracy theories are for you can surely make up for this at some point do not answer the questions still open on pages why are not you against twitter there are millions of times more data collected than the state i am a wool dyed red it did not feel well in 1976 when the logo was orange todays bourgeois parties for it therefore the exclusion of the as not bourgeois by pretty bold  by the way while the defended bourgeois democracy in 1933 with their lives the forerunners of voted when i am celebrating i am yes his speech on the enabling act of belongs to the proudest legacy of social democracy the party convention too this is what ms wants we say relief is impossible without economic not it parliamentary group was against the times when some countries were for it thank you thanks to all who have defended us today against the treason of the fatherland those who are not supporters no we just do not confuse liberal and libertarian on  in and on in some hold everything that is not your language opinion pas you should not be afraid of that do not worry you will not let me go that fast the problem is not the but the naked fiscal pact who refuses the the into ruin come on no but would not be a bad reason presumably then the bureaucracy costs of checking the parental income more expensive than the yield missed something text should i look at those who call themselves links have to pay attention to the social fascism vocabulary which has too many fiends in their mouths and i have also read the world of today  otherwise i would have known nothing of this reactionary slander i do not hope that with us me critical tweeds are blocked i just can not answer everyone thats genetically conditioned but its funny how media professionals get excited about it on and so far you read directly from me if employees were in my tweeting that would be indicated many democrats are outraged to write accusations of treason rightly so heres my statement as a traitors betrayal this most reactionary notions of the has historically cost many the life unbelievable what conservatives now back to the good sound the as a traitor betrayal this kind of hate do we know so nu communication is back it was fun  to bring a few pirates on deck see you soon nonsense there was neither coalition nor toleration with the left in no new elections yes 150 years of social democracy teach you need such binders because otherwise you will be the plaything of the powerful yes the has made such mistakes who wanted to contest that i hope we can finish in and put them up for discussion yes but it depends on what is in it yes basically its about the question how much insecurity is worth the freedom to me thats not easy to answer i think do not understand the question for the advisers at least i do not have one here with me on the way to and can tweet myself you  should only say before the election if they never want to see the election in a government because a government will give it lobbying can always be successful thats true in contrast critical publicity helps the most but coalitions we are far more than that and is the best example of this with its minority government coalitions counteract the fragmentation of parliament this fragmentation is exploited by lobbies right thats why we also arranged the event yesterday you should simply contact me you can not solve such topics via twitter you probably would not have done that anyway but please do not complain about tuition fees or missing daycare after the election its not just about politics  but mostly about the hidden interests behind it that will be a few hundred thousand working mothers seeing fathers differently because they need daycare to give just one example nice idea but those who make no firm arrangements will notice that usually the economically powerful prevail that we do want a grand coalition and do not do in doubt but has proven since ms force since 2010 in its about the direction of the country and you can be questioned and also evaluated like all other parties too classical campaigning is what the pirates do not say before the election what to do after the election do not lose coffee dear friend of big allegations what fraud do you mean it is not about coalition statements  it is important for voters to know which direction they prefer in case of doubt but you have to choose them if you want them as long as the pirates refuse before the choice to say what they do after the election you do not have to but then every voter has to know the pirates do not care if black and yellow determines the direction in not camp but direction more education fair wages real energy transition stand for want the opposite if you want to risk reintroducing tuition fees pay nursing care instead of nursery schooling get started in its about content no fees kindergarten and schools fair wages or the opposite or boss refuses to say who should rule in or so better yourself for clarity choose  of the pirate boss in the is clear who wants to play safe in must on 135 choose or talked to about and his book on the financial crisis more i actually found the dispute fruitful but fine good night it goes a bit too far for me to tell someone the same about the difference in a question to respect the civil rights no differences please transportation have a driver in principle yes arrives at the appointment discussions are with me do not know whether i always have so much time lets take a look is nothing special because i am on the way home and  since we know the advantages of the politician information the has massively reduced the income tax sir in the top earner area even too much who wants that we certainly not gladly but so far was not the case therefore and for reasons of content are like not completely pro as you say do you really think one of my coworkers would tweet with you like this yes that is unfortunately correct and reason for some justified mistrust and yet i find the comparison absurd for example we just did it to be in the we have to be completely without member it was probably the other way around during longer travel times like today  do not understand the comparison you do not have to but not everything that does not suit you is unconstitutional i like the talk shows i have to go to not they but you reduce civil rights to the rejection of protection against violence is one thing too you already have to read tweet what this related to otherwise it will be unfair i do not know if there were so many but even if you believe it they were are with me there was indeed a test contradiction in the matter has nothing to do with lack of appreciation and critical debates are needed according to the court the is not generally unconstitutional it depends on the design even if it sounds unfamiliar it should not go straight to win the election first  but about convictions maintaining prejudice is easier than checking it 150 years of history show enlightenment exchange arguments is worthwhile slogans not since on parental leave to do as if the is just the invention of the state is just not synonymous lets see talking is always good campaigning means promoting beliefs not talking to people about the mouth well here is probably the name program this debate including these studies should be held at an agreed meeting and civil rights need protection only very rich people can afford freedom alone i  rather believe that simplifications pretend something you could follow in the live stream as far as i know your right not interested in voices at any price better no voice than one out of misunderstanding just because one disagrees with you and determined you will not be treated pejoratively lets discuss it the debate according to the motto yes no black white is too easy for me but of course we also see the dangers of for the informational of every citizen thats why we have a hard time rejecting the simply because we see how important it can be against and terror my god how easy do you have to tick to assassinate complicated topics like this thats not true  unfortunately not today why especially with nonsensical tax not high incomes have to tax a bit course the wants sure now for the in and next year at the federal government that was your question right yes i think so too but one thing has nothing to do with the other the term has a truly murderous story for thank you ill think about it the was ready for almost everything at that time even changing the mp after years to the was offered to us the frequent use of old parties politicians makes me suspicious is the origin really unknown man are you linguistically elegant sorry but thats really not true but certain high risk  products could disappear the presidency the has just delivered a moving speech on we are proud that he is one of us both are allowed yes but exactly what the means by its proposal for a financial transaction tax look at where the term old parties comes from has a bad tradition that i hope you do not mean if it is so you are a happy person for many others the fight against old age poverty is sorely needed honestly i read both on paper daily because its about the relationship of workers and retirees retirement must be paid by fewer and fewer workers we are clear for the debt brake but it also needs growth initiatives success 0809 shows that  work arrangements economic stimulus programs thankfully fought her down agreed half of this federal government has voted against all what we have implemented in growth initiatives in 20089 if they speculate yes today everyone including the majority does not pay school program has also not been continued by the countries are with 20 billion a  underfunded tweet does not mean to please everyone right nonsense take a look at could have made a grand coalition two years ago is your right well there is probably the father of the will be thank you for the trust clear but already on election night above all we supported him in the election campaign on the other hand the were smart what do you expect from me apart from the fact that it would be strange if the chairman did not make an election campaign these are lost votes that help the and the the will also suffer the fate of sh in now confess color for the state election on 13 may in votes for the and  almost half is less than half majorities have to be accepted until the next vote i will not always do that every now and then you have time to think is just too well then greet the times thats cynical nonsense i do not understand why that the financial markets are to blame for why are not they finally taxing growth either the question at stake is what should grow what must shrink energy consumption we do not do that important is not the name but the content 2010 also means expansion of renewable energies schools number is 03022775310  oh that depends a lot on the conditions of does not mean that everything is allowed this is libertarian and not liberal that is true because i have not dealt with it mainly in the last 15 years everyone seems to doubt that twittering myself so now then go get 03025775310 i do not understand called and i congratulated together we want to work closely together for growth employment but not everyone can because they invited me you confuse me with your club plagiarisms are in vogue with you not with us do not worry from you get nothing from me boring again i do not always have time to tweet the conversation  will always have priority for me about that slept who organizes with my office what i do on business matters to you only what i do not do private yes difficult civil society must be supervisor of the supervisor more important than state data protection therefore do more for daycare schools instead of childcare allowance the problem of the coming years will not be too few jobs but too few why not agreements with me but not on chaos sign up in the office a rink until then to maybe exactly well what did you think are you destined  not i am not surprised she prefers to go to the next chancellor must go to the world social summit instead of i know do we have to change because nobody can pay todays retirees live much longer and unfortunately we have far too few children representative association transaction tax works council meeting book price for long as they do not govern so what but at some point young liberals also read again thats a good idea or joint event in the or now you have to reach the same with the recommended this morning only because its you  why only if i could i would make years in the city council as a requirement for mandates yes as prime minister or chief in big signal to and a reliable friend of the the consequences of the elections in for ms my interview in the i make who wants to stay the course in education work energy transition must choose else helps black and yellow he says just got up earlier than me the talks there to terrorism would also make the opponents of data retention i only do it when i have the time for example on longer car rides or if someone as now has transferred i did not  seen after the crime scene is over enough for me to take off to talk on talk shows i can not find the tweet to go to maybe the author can send it again but you have to tell the pirates not us because they have excluded but you have to understand yes thats true but to check that makes sense then its finally about content again i only expected honestly i do not mean it at all aggressively i just do not want to skim over nonsense just to be nice sorry but you should not only expect professionalism from politicians but also from those who interview us thank you error i do it myself but my boys want to slow me down even in a good mood but  if a political journalist does not understand the constitution then you just have to explain it to her for the 10th time in a row and the lose state elections heres why felicitation 519 that is the end of and the beginning of a better i know guys like you can be nevertheless there are three winners and three massive losers and dark red if the in 2009 had 254 and now around 30 this is a gain after even if it does not suit you honestly it was not art for this one must master only the basic operations apart from proving eggs in the pants differently we will govern together with and i just got on  made rather fat than stupid very bad if you are both so beware just do not increase the not want and you have to understand that because they are a very young party if it did it would not be bad either but actually you have to master only the basic operations thats but since they do want to govern they do not matter for the policy change in do not want the pirates by the way can i understand can not expect it it is never about politics in politics being young is no merit old is his privilege better opportunities for another financial market regulation and taxation investment in labor employment have one more suits me  but not anymore of the itself green win this shows who has to govern in the north is 525 we keep our fingers crossed nope i am more often where exactly should i come to i hope so dear certainly not after 20 years of politics with mirrors pictures etc used to a lot thats not only when twittering do you have so far yes if not it would be marked the one does not exclude the other from me like probably true and i know that it takes a long time to get there  it is constructed but can be lost quickly right but not always means short also clear but lets try it thank you its really fun not only have time for it no thats not but an opinion may have the still man you could not have given me the advice earlier nice if you do not has prejudices right right but first comes then every encounter and when as now time is even tweets do my very best i did not know yet is always worthwhile tried 2002 with the reintroduction of countries try it for the second time that certainly not but as profound as yours will be the  saying is really good so far only 177 turnout nonvoters choose if you want kindergartens it schools and energy transition you have to choose 1800 followers 1800 times thanks for the interest react and as soon as possible between office election campaign and changing table thanks for the warm welcome on twitter i look forward to holding debates here as well just the of has made me so curious on twitter that i just try it "}]
