coverage 2001 president secretary secretary team up governor presidential secretary team up regime discourse it has already been fixed but we need to determine once again that the revision has been done at a public discussion meeting in addition it is not shared also in the and the visits a monument of sex slave in the it is also fact that discourse is on the basis for that ground at a public discussion meeting however at the time of the administration we made a cabinet decision that there was nothing to prove compulsion but many people do not know about that at public discussion meeting in this context discourse is politically and diplomatically issued in a certain sense yo then the army forcibly entered the mans house brought the woman like a man and made it a comfort woman is supposed to carry on this shame now at a public discussion meeting  about discourse for the problem of comfort women i have been studying with my result is that there was nothing to show this there was not anything backed up to the testimony at a public debate session live broadcast from on the state of the presidential street speech meeting to be held in front of station from 16 today please come and listen to everyone i have lost the economic and fiscal advisory council live at so it is also a big problem that the between the of and the government that was constantly in the administration was lost at a public discussion meeting so it is not that we do not have to raise taxes but if deflation continues as it has been it should not be raised as it can be raised it is extremely important to make an effort at a public discussion meeting i must reflect on the situation in 1997 in the era of prime minister the nominal was 513 trillion yen the current balance is 470 trillion yen tax revenue was 51 trillion yen but since the expenditure was kept to 81 trillion yen the primary balance could be compressed to trillion yen now it is over 30 trillion yen at the debate  to raise the tax rate is to raise tax revenue to the the nominal does not increase the tax revenue does not increase easily but i agree to raise the base tax rate from to 10 but of course thats when i make a mistake in time i will break the economy at a public discussion session and the chief is also the education chief the chief of education is chosen by the chief the chief is in the election i promise to go to such education to the citizen through the chief educator i will clarify my responsibilities to consult with the of education an advisory body to clarify the responsibilities and to clarify the relationship with the peoples will at a public discussion meeting one of the drafts we are currently making at is not to eliminate the of let the board of education be an advisory body let the supervisor become the chief of education again there was a problem of bullying at school responsibility is it a a head or a board of education the of is responsible at a public discussion meeting there are many good people but those who are not are carrying a tough task so virtually everything is decided by virtue of the materials prepared by the chief education secretariat facts at a public discussion meeting  following this it was supposed to be a curriculum guidelines textbooks were supposed to appear but adoption of textbooks is decided by the of education but the of is not composed by people at a public discussion meeting education the revised was a complete rewrite the clearly wrote the educational goals cultivate morality public respecting the tradition and culture of local love and patriotism i wrote that primarily households are responsible for education at a public debate there is a person saying that it is twilight but there is not such a thing it depends on what leadership of politics to do it depends surely welcomes a new morning by the right decision the execution power at a public debate session the prolonged deflation the high yen the economy is sluggish the young people are unable to find dreams and hopes in the future now we are getting out of deflation and the economy at a public discussion meeting at the moment in the territory is going to be threatened unless we declare our determination to resolutely defend ourselves it will not be at a public debate meeting  there is no wait and about the earthquake i was able to learn something important to us what we should protect it is an important family a loving and respectful home it is irreplaceable at a public discussion meeting the great earthquake disaster that occurred on march 11 last year has become an unforgettable event for us now there are still 340000 people forced to live a difficult life and now we must promote a vigorous reconstruction with all with leadership in politics at a public debate session will soon be appearing at 13 05 press president secretary up and in 1970 when said that it was theirs was supposed to belong to us if it was ours that is of money what i have to clarify is that until there is an announcement that there are resources around the in 1968 there was no interest in at all islands at weekly newspaper of money  although we are not suddenly an armed attack we should do a simulation at that time to eliminate when people have landed it is absolutely necessary to never let them land and absolutely 12 nautical miles we need to organize a system that we can not enter the territorial waters at that time the alliance relationship between and the was exactly right which is extremely important even though it said that it carries out effective control there is always a ship of maritime insurance it is not easy to understand that people are living this is an island in news i took out a 3000 ton ship and kept on getting on my body and damaged the other party although a terrible protest came from over there against the protest no more try hard to do in administration i went to with the government as a strict message that president told and stopped there in the same month the confederation of challenged the landing although it was a very good mood during the day but i decided not to make a definite landing i ordered the of  shortly from 11 30 of appearance governor secretary general up i experienced various things as a prime minister including setbacks now it is said that is heading for dusk but never such a thing depends on what i do we will grow the economy with political leadership protect and welcome us with a shining morning with a wakeup plus meeting of the restoration there are also places where they can be together or not education and constitutional revision agree as a philosophy but policies are not matured in framework after the election the composition changes drastically as a result of the election of the of there may be some kind of change in the even in the of agreement on policies is obviously important wake up plus since the managed to go to from the beginning in an effort to go somehow in the considerably is a i will not let you go to the table unless i promise from the beginning it is the position of in a wakeup plus  in the first place the government has no bargaining power so in the usual case and the are cooperating in advance because they are allies in a wake up plus negotiation matches national interest it is all with a wakeup plus as a result of not being thinking that this may be taken away with a pipeline while demonstrating resolute determination while having discussion with the wrong impression the other side it will prevent such conflicts with a wakeup plus but it is not a sticky relationship i will definitely stop it if i challenge the island i actually did that kind of thing with wake up plus relationship when i took office as prime minister the relationship between and was very bad in prime time as a result of negotiating with various pipes we mutually confirmed the strategic reciprocal relationship at the wakeup plus i gradually do this kind of thing as we go ahead it will mean that pressure will be applied all the way so withdrawing there it means that if you apply pressure to you will give in if you think carefully and decide what decided absolutely quickly i will carry out at the wakeup plus  it is good that it was held in the country concrete measure of effective control there are other islands that are the starting point of although this nationalization and management must proceed public officials will stay on the island with a wakeup plus it is said that is aiming for resources in the area as well they are finally saying that they are core profits so there is a alliance strengthening the alliance and in some cases jointly exercising to prevent landing in and the will show joint will to demonstrate will in up plus nationalization president of the president expelled the from base in the is a fragile army with only a warship four of which were controversial with within the next years we are going to have the same policy objectives relations between the government and the of if we can withdraw from deflation we should withdraw from deflation banks use it freely or the of mission is price stability but in other countries maximizing employment is also included we should think about that at  since it is not in the situation of corporate investment and consumption coming soon public investment to protect life safety national land or infrastructure for regional productivity and competitiveness enhancement in up plus monetary policy is an important pillar of policy in the world and the also supports the economy by printing a considerable dollar in the in as well the government and the of should cooperate in policy making monetary easing in up plus the regime is centered on so to speak growing in a wakeup plus consumption tax if the deflation situation seems to be going on if there is such a judgment i will raise it it can not in the wakeup plus lawmakers is soon wakeup plus
