My ambition is that within 15 years we’ll diagnose cancer much earlier in at least 50,000 more people a year. Combined with the great care provided by our NHS, that will mean every year 22,000 more people will survive for years beyond diagnosis. https://t.co/IMl0u6F7tn My very best wishes to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on their wedding day. To all of those joining the national celebration with street parties and other events, have a wonderful day. #RoyalWedding Gravesham’s @AdamHollowayMP is a big supporter of @EllenorCharity, a hospice in his constituency.

Thank you to everyone who came to @WelshConserv Conference today. https://t.co/BxnqqtZerQ This afternoon I travelled to Skopje and was delighted to meet Prime Minister @Zoran_Zaev and his ministers – the first UK Prime Minister to have visited in almost 20 years. https://t.co/vye40fInaz I’ve been in Bulgaria meeting EU and Western Balkan leaders, including @EmmanuelMacron and Chancellor Merkel. Next year the UK leaves the EU, but we are not leaving Europe. We’ll continue to work with our allies to protect our collective security and champion our shared values. https://t.co/fpJUszIPok The proportion of people in work is at a record 75.6%, the highest since records began in 1971. There’s more to do, but the decisions we’re taking are building a strong economy, and a Britain that’s fit for the future. https://t.co/ooddJ4aoKW This morning I had a great time meeting the inspirational @WeAreInvictus UK team at their launch in Horse Guards Parade.

My sympathies to her loving family - Dame Tessa’s campaigning on brain cancer research is a lasting tribute to a lifetime of public service. https://t.co/4KIULm0Stb The path I set out here is the path to deliver the Brexit people voted for. I will need your help and support to get there.

It is an honour to be unveiling her statue in Parliament Square later today. https://t.co/BvmfhvaElS On the feast day of England's patron saint, I wish a Happy St George's Day to all celebrating. https://t.co/TTS0MF09mb My warmest congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their baby boy.

International experts agree that young people need 12 years of quality education if they’re to fulfil their potential. I want #CHOGM18 to be the summit where the Commonwealth agrees to make that the goal for all our members. https://t.co/TBNfU9GEJk I was pleased to meet members of the Commonwealth Youth Forum with Prince Harry. They have worked hard to uphold the values of the Commonwealth. #CHOGM2018 https://t.co/nMMC37CPE9 The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat – we must take a stand and defend them. https://t.co/6iTV8uAPio This morning, I gave a statement on the situation in Syria: https://t.co/ESCzCA7KqO .@JuliaLopezMP is a great supporter of local charity @firststep1988 who do excellent work in her Hornchurch constituency helping families and their very young children with special needs to maximise their potential. https://t.co/L46QsDdXDa Today we’re giving millions of taxpayers a break.

Based in her constituency, it provides emergency motorbike transportation of blood and other urgent items throughout the night for NHS hospitals in Sussex - 365 days a year. A vital service, instrumental in saving lives. https://t.co/JVMTqQfB6t This was not just an act of attempted murder in Salisbury – nor just an act against UK. It is an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. https://t.co/iMh3CfvCy8 Professor Stephen Hawking was a brilliant and extraordinary mind - one of the great scientists of his generation. His courage, humour and determination to get the most from life was an inspiration. His legacy will not be forgotten. With a strong economy we can continue to create jobs, invest in public services and build a country that works for everyone. #SpringStatement https://t.co/f5mg3LSA9Q It was great to be in Harrow earlier today with @BobBlackman campaigning for @HAConservatives. https://t.co/ztmGpqfn3r .@HuddlestonNigel has long supported the work of @ActiononPoverty in his constituency.

I'm passionate about getting more women to run for their local council and to become Members of Parliament.

Visit the @Conservatives #Askhertostand site for more information about how to become a candidate: https://t.co/alVSwYj2Q8 #IWD2018 Thousands of women endure unimaginable violence and other forms of abuse every single day. I am determined to stop this - and the government’s new domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the change we need. #IWD18 https://t.co/IpWVSRmplr .@jeremycorbyn: 'to mansplain - verb informal - explaining (something) to someone, typically a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronising.' #PMQs #IWD2018 https://t.co/dZQuPByChF With #IWD2018 on Thursday, it's important to recognise the journey that many female MPs embarked on to reach the Commons - Trudy's story is a testament to her commitment to Copeland: https://t.co/l0Vi1gKzUm The size of the challenge is matched only by the strength of my ambition to tackle it. https://t.co/iGflbwAJYW Here's to all the 'bloody difficult women' out today on the #March4Women. https://t.co/8QdFdTRBxk I have an ambition for our future with the EU - the right Brexit deal for Britain. Now let's get on with it. https://t.co/zRCJzbWfyK Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed. In the current bad weather, I want to say thank you to everyone going the extra mile to keep our country moving - and to keep us safe. Thank you to NHS staff and care workers, the police and the armed forces, and all those working to keep our vital public services going. https://t.co/OyYvKAeYjt Tomorrow I will set out the next step on the #RoadtoBrexit https://t.co/wcGRQmOXqN On the final day of LGBT+ history month it's important to remember that LGBT+ history is all our history. LGBT+ success is everyone's success. And LGBT+ rights are human rights. #LGBTHM18🏳️‍🌈 https://t.co/CN54SQIwOL It's often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs. Today we've set out a plan to force energy companies to change their ways. Our price cap will cut bills for millions of families - another step we are taking to help people make ends meet. https://t.co/muiJdx9ifz Welcome home @TeamGB with their record-breaking haul of medals from the #PyeongChang2018 Winter Olympics. 🥇🥉🥉🥉🥉 Now let’s all get behind @ParalympicsGB! #WeAreTheGreat #BeFearless https://t.co/WsEY8F8twI It's absolutely right that we support our brave troops. That's why we've just launched the 24/7 @DefenceHQ Military Mental Health Helpline on 0800 323 4444 so those in our armed forces and their families will always have somewhere to turn to when they need support. https://t.co/rcUOyHUV7t Matt sent this to me and it's in my office @10DowningStreet. It exemplifies how great he is at taking major political events and seeing the humour in them. It’s always good for politicians to laugh at ourselves and he helps us to do that. Congratulations for 30 years @Telegraph. https://t.co/bt012RibEi Thanks to the hard work of @bicgreen, more people will be benefiting from learning new skills whilst also helping the environment.

She truly is an inspiration to us all. https://t.co/ys2nkKmn0M Tonight the Labour Party voted against cutting stamp duty for first-time buyers. Sign up to back our plan to put people before politics: https://t.co/dOem9yiH2d https://t.co/pKc4MiWkeu Always nice to meet activists from Calder Valley Conservatives - no matter their age - although maybe some of them aren’t quite old enough to go door-knocking just yet. https://t.co/AaGXqt2Tnq Just landed back in the UK to the news @TheYarnold has won gold - congratulations on a fantastic achievement. https://t.co/YLHv5G24o6 .@stgileshospice is a wonderful local charity and provides specialist care and support for those with serious illnesses in the Midlands. A big thank you to them for the work they do and for the support for them from local MP @Mike_Fabricant. I've made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing market - figures today show the number of first-time buyers has reached an 11-year high. We must do more, but initiatives like Help to Buy and cutting stamp duty for many are truly helping more people own their own home. https://t.co/6fL4lEJk7T This Government is leading the world in making sure that vile terrorist content is stamped out. Technology like this can heavily disrupt the terrorists' actions, prevent their poisonous propaganda and help keep people in the UK safe. https://t.co/hIn1zMsQfN Really great to join Mike Freer MP and the @Finchleytories team and talk to so many locals about the issues that matter to them. https://t.co/B1mxOWBFYP Well done to all the pupils at @LittleLeighSch and @WinsfordAcademy for supporting @StLukesHospice, who do vital work in @Sandbach's constituency. https://t.co/rYppfYZ0Zx Nikki is an inspiring young woman and it was wonderful to meet her last year and to record an interview which you can see on @CBBC at 4pm today. https://t.co/KGK3PxLHLh We're cracking down on unscrupulous puppy breeders to further raise the bar on animal welfare standards - and we need your help to find evidence so we can ban third-party puppy sales: https://t.co/Sg64arVXow https://t.co/3ck0kEdnFn Wonderful to meet so many talented and passionate young people in Manchester – all of them working to help improve their communities. #Vote100 https://t.co/X1PywWt2ux Being an MP is the best job in the world, and just like my colleagues here, I want more women to get elected to Parliament. #Vote100 https://t.co/Gsp46rwX86 I want to see more women entering Parliament. I would say to any woman that does, be yourself, don't feel you've got to judge yourself by male stereotype, be yourself and believe what you're doing - because you can make a real difference to other people's lives. #Vote100 https://t.co/pW68WtCwPm What better way to start today's #Vote100 celebrations than by gathering with all the talented female MPs in Parliament. More must be done, but I'm proud that there are over 200 female MPs - our democracy is stronger as a result. https://t.co/Gy7Y6AJVup Debate is a key British tradition but threats and abuse have no place in society. We all have a role to play to make sure the intimidation we have witnessed over the weekend is not commonplace. Tomorrow I'll outline my vision for a more tolerant and respectful United Kingdom. https://t.co/xGe1ny1MTN .@amessd_southend is right to be a proud supporter of the excellent @MusicManProject, based in his constituency. A wonderful music education service specifically for children and adults with learning difficulties. https://t.co/I6SSM8CD2o Too many people with mental ill health still face appalling injustices and stigma every day. Tackling those injustices is a priority for me. Let's work together to break the silence around mental health. #TimetoTalk https://t.co/zM8svV1bkf I made it my personal mission to help build the homes people need, so everyone can afford a safe, decent place to live - that's why today we've announced the first wave of funding from the £5 billion Housing Infrastructure Fund. https://t.co/Oy2KOip4cm There are huge trade opportunities in China that we want to help British businesses take advantage of. That is why I’ve taken 50 businesses with me, representing all corners of the UK and sectors in which the UK excels. #PMinChina🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/bqtXJ6Sjjn My thanks go to Premier Li for the warm welcome I received in Beijing. I am pleased we agreed to intensify the Golden Era of UK-China relations, working together to tackle global and regional security challenges and build sustainable economies of the future. #PMinChina 🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/X2KX9LFEeC Philip and I really enjoyed visiting the Yellow Crane Tower to watch some traditional Chinese opera. The performers were incredibly talented. #PMinChina 🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/SsF5jBBx72 It was a pleasure to meet local experts on the banks of the Yangtze River, hearing about Wuhan’s efforts to reduce pollution in the river and in the city’s lakes, including from micro plastic pollution. #PMinChina 🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/HxYQb8Yk9X I was delighted to visit Wuhan to celebrate the close educational ties between the UK and China. The agreements we signed will enable more young people than ever to share ideas about our two great nations. https://t.co/htJYbsli48 #PMinChina 🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/9wqwxXayVu We said we'd ensure 95 per cent of UK premises had access to super fast broadband - and we've delivered. More people are now able to be better connected, with 50,000 new jobs created as a result. https://t.co/dFg9wW3nFr On #HolocaustMemorialDay we stand together to honour the lives lost and those who survived. I pledge do everything in my power to ensure we never forget where prejudice and hatred can lead. https://t.co/64LZzrTwGV There is more to do but today’s news that the number of first-time buyers is at the highest level since 2007 shows our mission to deliver the homes we need, backed by practical policies like our stamp duty cut for first-time buyers, is making good progress. https://t.co/wcJKxPR3xF I welcome this decision, which is good news for British industry. Bombardier and its innovative workforce play a vital role in the Northern Ireland economy. https://t.co/h9T1sVfFig Official statistics published today show that our economy is continuing to grow - by almost 17% since 2010. A strong economy is essential to be able to fund our schools, hospitals and other precious public services. https://t.co/2Unwzk1kYY .@HorseBackUK do amazing work in @AndrewBowieMP’s constituency - using horsemanship to help veterans and those injured serving in the armed forces, to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude. https://t.co/Sz0VPLaZ1b Tech companies need to take their responsibilities to society seriously. That’s why today at #Davos18, in front of the world’s leading business men and women, I will set out how together we can shape the standards, norms and rules of how we behave in the digital world. #WEF18 https://t.co/PMgXWVTNvL Today I announced new funding for Manchester following last year’s terror attack, bringing total government support to just over £24m. This includes a new £4.1m commitment for all NHS acute costs and the North West Ambulance Service. https://t.co/j6HMjZx0DC https://t.co/kOkgWoRkpT Unemployment has fallen again - it's down by over a million since the @Conservatives came to government, meaning more people are getting into work, able to provide for their families and build a better future for themselves and their children. https://t.co/BDlHz17rZi My very best wishes to Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank on their engagement - congratulations to the happy couple. https://t.co/VfTnM4QJvy .@cvs_uttlesford are a great organisation supported by patron @KemiBadenoch - helping smaller charities and community groups thrive. https://t.co/JCUHA4FwoM It was a real pleasure to meet pupils at Waltham St Lawrence Primary School in my constituency to celebrate their recent 'Outstanding' rating by Ofsted. Well done to all at the school. https://t.co/eR1qkjT9QJ At the @V_and_A last night @EmmanuelMacron and I were proud to celebrate the extraordinary values and the talented people who link our countries.

A Labour Party that will always put politics before people. https://t.co/Hnua5uIAo5 .@tracey_crouch will work with @JoCoxFoundation, businesses and charities to shine a light on loneliness and create the first ever Government strategy for it. We should all do everything we can to see that, in Jo’s memory, we bring an end to the acceptance of loneliness for good. https://t.co/RoJPYEG6yn Jo Cox recognised the scale of loneliness across the country and dedicated herself to doing all she could to help those affected. The Government will build on her legacy with @tracey_crouch as a new Minister for Loneliness: https://t.co/AWk1tbyjKQ For far too many, loneliness is a sad reality of modern life. I want us all to confront this and take action to address loneliness endured by the elderly, by carers, those who have lost loved ones – those with no one to talk to or share their thoughts and experiences with. https://t.co/42DbUKuDYb Last week I set out Government’s plan to leave our environment in a better state than we found it. I urged supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles and Iceland have today said they will eliminate plastic packaging by 2023 – I hope others follow suit. https://t.co/g8iarTJg9F With 110 days to go until the London local elections, it was great to be out with the excellent @ScullyP and the @SuttonTories Council candidates – talking to people about the issues that really matter to them. https://t.co/esDP4x0u7T From today we're banning hidden charges for paying with your credit or debit card - a move that will help millions of people avoid rip-off fees when spending their hard-earned money. https://t.co/EEk5jxdk7R We are helping people earn more and keep more of what they earn. Inequality is lower than it was in 2010 and the poorest fifth of households have more disposable income than in 2008. https://t.co/G1gtBb1mKR Please do follow and support @Equinepuk - a Leeds based equine therapy organisation championed by @andreajenkyns.

A better world for each of us to live in and a better future for the next generation. https://t.co/Ek7DkqCFHL There's more to do, but we should be proud that manufacturing output is at the highest level in 10 years. https://t.co/5bSKGAJqeR It was great to visit @WWTLondon this morning and do a spot of birdwatching with pupils from @LowtherSchool – we were there to launch our #25yearplan for the environment. https://t.co/k3HlmsqYvL Today I set out the important action the Government is taking to end avoidable plastic waste and protect our environment. #25yearplan https://t.co/LgUc6PNoAH We’re building a Britain #FitForTheFuture.

It will stop billions of pieces of plastic entering our ecosystem, helping to protect our precious seas and oceans. https://t.co/gG39Dc0aLS In 2015 we introduced the 5p charge on plastic carrier bags, we now see 9bn fewer bags being used. It's making a real difference. We want to do the same with single use plastics. Nobody who watched #BluePlanet2 will doubt the need for us to do something - and we will. #Marr We're putting £5.7m into creating a new national forest. 120-miles - from Bradford, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. https://t.co/P9na6CiYx2 #Marr Since privatisation, usage of the railways has doubled. And we have seen the biggest investment since Victorian times in our railways. Around 97p in every £1 in fares goes back into running and improving services. #Marr https://t.co/NEN514Ws2J The NHS is delivering for people, it is treating more people and more people are being seen within the four hours every day. But of course, nothing is perfect. And there is more for us to do. #Marr https://t.co/NaG8fohbXy Eight million tonnes of plastic makes its way into the world’s seas and oceans each year - our government will do all it can to play its part in stopping this. The work of @BudeCleanerSeas is vital to that ambition. Do follow and support their work, as @scottmann4NC does: https://t.co/UDYz0jow9V Thank you to the NHS staff who work hard and do a fantastic job for us day in and day out all year round. Their dedication ensures people get the treatment they need - we've put in an additional £437 million to help, so the NHS has been better prepared than ever this winter. https://t.co/0wAclwHSqN I'm working hard to help young people get onto the housing ladder. That's why I was delighted to meet Laura in her new home today.
